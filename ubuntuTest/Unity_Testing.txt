0,[00:00] <linux_is_my_hero> kevin147: another option. if you bought it with a credit card, don't pay that part of the balance. dispute the charge for the monitor by talking to your credit card company by telling them you were shipped a broken monitor. also, you could break it yourself before you ship it back. then ship it back to hp and dont buy from them again. thats what i would do.
0,[00:01] <Shaeykh> Does 11.04 ship with GNOME 3?
0,[00:01] <Kevin147> bought it at the store
0,[00:01] <Kron> Shaeykh, No
0,[00:01] <Shaeykh> Thank you, Kron
0,[00:01] <Kron> Shaeykh, NP :)
0,[00:02] <linux_is_my_hero> also, you can contact the better business bureau and your local chamber of commerce if they give you shitty customer service at the store.
0,[00:02] <Somelauw> Shaeykh: No, but you can install gnome 3 yourself on it.
0,[00:02] <linux_is_my_hero> kevin147: also, you can contact the better business bureau and your local chamber of commerce if they give you poor customer service at the store
0,[00:02] <Kevin147> linux_is_my_hero: they did, they couldn't even speak english! I was so ticked dude :/
0,[00:02] <Kevin147> I will call em
0,[00:03] <Kevin147> All I know, is that I'm changing either to 10.10, or I'm going with pclinuxos
0,[00:03] <Cheese> Would anyone have any idea why my internet connection is so slow on ubuntu?
0,[00:03] <Kron> Kevin147, Soooo many call centers overseas these days... they just read scripts :(
0,[00:03] <Kevin147> Cheese: 11.04?
0,[00:03] <linux_is_my_hero> cheese: I'M HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM!
0,[00:03] <Cheese> yessir
0,[00:03] <Kevin147> wireless?
0,[00:03] <linux_is_my_hero> YES
0,[00:03] <Cheese> it was slow on 10.10 to
0,[00:03] <Cheese> yes wireless
0,[00:03] <Kevin147> yup
0,[00:03] <Kevin147> for some reason
0,[00:03] <Kevin147> since 10.10 and up
0,[00:04] <Kevin147> my laptop has slow internet also on wireless
0,[00:04] <Kevin147> rather that, on any wireless I use
0,[00:04] <Kevin147> its slower
0,[00:04] <linux_is_my_hero> i had 10.10 and every version before and with 10.10 and every version before it was fast. i think its because ubuntu one is set to be on, which is why i'm here. i don't want a cloud, i have an external hdd.
0,[00:04] <syrinx_> !enter | Kevin147
0,[00:04] <ubottu> Kevin147: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line. Don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
0,[00:04] <Cheese> Is there any way i could install fedora along with linux and windows 7
0,[00:04] <Cheese> Triple booting with grub?
0,[00:04] <linux_is_my_hero> if anyone knows how to turn off ubuntu one from ever loading in 11.04, please tell us
0,[00:04] <Kevin147> syrinx_: sorry, when I think I do it in lines, my bad
0,[00:04] <Nexxy> would someone care to shed some light on this issue? I am unable to create/delete an "invisible" folder; https://gist.github.com/956221
0,[00:04] <linux_is_my_hero> cheese: just install win 7 then fedora then ubuntu
0,[00:04] <syrinx_> Kevin147: its ok :D
0,[00:04] <Tropic> how can i installar aircrack? i don't have connection of another pc and i can't download here
0,[00:04] <Cheese> i already have windows
0,[00:04] <Kron> Cheese, Depending on what you need it to do a Virtualbox VM may work well
0,[00:04] <Cheese> and ubuntu
0,[00:05] <Cheese> and i want to install fedora
0,[00:05] <Kevin147> syrinx_: and I'm just sorta mad atm, so thats also why :/ sorry bout that
0,[00:05] <syrinx_> Kevin147: what's the problem?
0,[00:05] <Kevin147> cheekee: install windows first, then fedora, then ubuntu
0,[00:05] <Cheese> If i just install fedora regularly wont i just make a third partition and grub will recognize fedora?
0,[00:05] <Kevin147> so you'll have grub to choose the os
0,[00:05] <FoolsRun> Hi, I just cloned my hdd to a new, larger drive. Can anyone tell me, or link me to instructions on how to restore GRUB to the NEW hdd while booted to the old one?
0,[00:05] <Cheese> Its to late.
0,[00:05] <Kevin147> syrinx_: Ubuntu 11.04 drivers fried my monitor
0,[00:05] <Cheese> Im not uninstalling windows and ubutnu
0,[00:05] <Cheese> just to reinstall them
0,[00:05] <Omega> if you install Ubuntu or Fedora first it doesn't matter much
0,[00:05] <syrinx_> Kevin147: ouch
0,[00:06] <Omega> Cheese: you can install them side by side
0,[00:06] <Cheese> Ok, i already have windows and ubuntu
0,[00:06] <Pretto> why .bash_history is empty on every logon?
0,[00:06] <jimmybrite> I upgraded 10.10 to 11.04, I dual boot, and now I can't boot into ANY os at all, long story short, grub2 messed up my mbr something fierce, can anyone direct me the right way, i'm geting nowhere with the grub2 ubuntu documentation, re-installing grub doesnt work, im getting "cannot stat aufs"
0,[00:06] <Cheese> if i install fedora regularly now, will everything work out?
0,[00:06] <Kevin147> syrinx_: yup :/ so I'm changing over to pclinuxos as soon as possible on my laptop & desktop once I buy, yet again, another brand new monitor
0,[00:06] <linux_is_my_hero> omega: so fedora works with the grub that's already there? :-)
0,[00:06] <Somelauw> Okay, I think I won't upgrade to 11.4 for a while reading all those negative comments.
0,[00:06] <Omega> Cheese: do you have an empty partition for Fedora?
0,[00:06] <Kron> Pretto, Sounds like a permissions problem
0,[00:06] <Omega> linux_is_my_hero: I think it will
0,[00:06] <Cheese> Im not sure
0,[00:06] <syrinx_> Kevin147: this has happened before?
0,[00:06] <Cheese> Im pretty sure it will ask me to make another partition in the installation process
0,[00:06] <Kevin147> jimmy1980: i had the same problem, is it saying grub > ?
0,[00:07] <Cheese> jimmy
0,[00:07] <Cheese> you installed ubuntu with wubi
0,[00:07] <Kevin147> syrinx_: nope, never happened before, been using ubuntu since 9.04 or w/e, and my house burned, so I just bought these new comps like 4 months ago
0,[00:07] <Cheese> and now you installed 11.04 and it doesnt work with wubi
0,[00:07] <Cheese> Anyway. Wont it ask for another partition when installing fedora?
0,[00:07] <Pretto> Kron: weird, my .bash_history is owned by root :O
0,[00:07] <Kevin147> jimmybrite: i had the same problem, is it saying grub > ?
0,[00:07] <MrKeuner> hello, natty here... in synaptic, items in residual config section cannot be purged... Any idea what may be wrong? is it me or everyone?
0,[00:07] <Kevin147> sorry about that jimmy1980, theres to many jimmy's XD
0,[00:08] <GiNeeRiNG> when a device gives me only option for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx for DNS settings and their are only 2 digitds
0,[00:08] <GiNeeRiNG> what do i do?
0,[00:08] <syrinx_> GiNeeRiNG: IP addresses dont have 2 digits....
0,[00:08] <Kron> Pretto, Not sure why that would happen, you know how to chown it?
0,[00:08] <Omega> Cheese: yes, but you need empty space
0,[00:08] <GiNeeRiNG> Omega,
0,[00:08] <Cheese> I hve plenty
0,[00:08] <FoolsRun> Is it possible to restore GRUB to /dev/sdb from /deb/sda  with the intention of booting from that second afterwards?
0,[00:08] <GiNeeRiNG> so just put zeros where there are none?
0,[00:08] <syrinx_> GiNeeRiNG: yes
0,[00:09] <GiNeeRiNG> syrinx_,
0,[00:09] <GiNeeRiNG> its for dns configure
0,[00:09] <Pretto> Kron: yes, i did it let's see if it happens again :D
0,[00:09] <GiNeeRiNG> so empty space, gotcha
0,[00:09] <syrinx_> GiNeeRiNG: something like 73.34.0.0
0,[00:09] <Pretto> Kron: thank you
0,[00:09] <GiNeeRiNG> right.
0,[00:09] <Omega> GiNeeRiNG: you put a 0 in front
0,[00:09] <Kron> Pretto, My pleasure :)
0,[00:09] <GiNeeRiNG> should i use the secondary or primary?
0,[00:09] <Omega> GiNeeRiNG: 004.004.004.004 == 4.4.4.4
0,[00:10] <GiNeeRiNG> Omega, roger
0,[00:11] <Omega> GiNeeRiNG: you need a primary DNS server

0,[00:13] <Omega> and then try removing that
0,[00:13] <jimmybrite> this is such a pain, this is not something I was expecting to tackle with 11.04, this is making me want to switch to something else

0,[00:19] <GiNeeRiNG> syrinx_, plz inform me.
0,[00:20] <Omega> Yeah, it might be treating it as an octal number with the leading zeroes
0,[00:20]  * hiexpo hola all

0,[00:20] <syrinx_> no leading zeroes, no stars
0,[00:20] <GiNeeRiNG> the stars were just x'ing out numbers

0,[00:21] <syrinx_> get rid of the leading zeroes

0,[00:28] <toto654> big sorry
0,[00:28] <Omega> GiNeeRiNG: you probably need both
0,[00:28] <jimmybrite> I also followed the documentation step by step on the ubuntu website, but it seems outdated
0,[00:28] <GiNeeRiNG> theres only one field
0,[00:28] <Omega> jimmybrite: Oh, you already tried the documentation
0,[00:28] <GiNeeRiNG> the router is pppoe

0,[00:29] <jimmybrite> I tried installing 11.04 like 7 times already, clean install, or update

0,[00:30] <jimmybrite> <Omega> k ill try that
0,[00:30] <GiNeeRiNG> does dsl provide static ip's?
0,[00:30] <GiNeeRiNG> or dynamic?
0,[00:30] <toto654> hiexpo kron.......thx, sorry i added the code source repo not the normal one
0,[00:31] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, Kinda jumping in in the middle here, but the media port is probably for their software and the web port is for accessing it via a browser. You shouldn't need to do anything to access it if you're on a private LAN.
0,[00:31] <GiNeeRiNG> right, but Kron it isnt connecting to the netowkr
0,[00:31] <GiNeeRiNG> that is the problem
0,[00:31] <Omega> jimmybrite: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#METHOD%203%20-%20CHROOT
0,[00:31] <GiNeeRiNG> it is using PPPOE name and PASSWORD
0,[00:31] <hiexpo> toto654, no worries
0,[00:31] <Nexxy> Omega: I tried mv to no avail, stat returns 1777
0,[00:32] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, DSL can be configured either way. If you're with a big ISP it's probably dynamic unless you're paying for a static
0,[00:32] <jimmybrite> yeah, I just didnt try the chroot method yet, I was getting too aggravated earlier, I needed a breather
0,[00:32] <sooth> Where can I get jdk-5 (either openjdk or sun-jdk)?
0,[00:32] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, Do you know what private IP on your local network it's getting and if so can you ping it from a computer on the same LAN?
0,[00:32] <jimmybrite> but it IS strange, that a clean install totally breaks my mbr&grub2
0,[00:32] <hiexpo> sooth, that is old
0,[00:32] <sooth> hiexpo: Android needs it
0,[00:32] <GiNeeRiNG> i dont think it is getting an ip

0,[00:33] <hiexpo> sooth, try java site
0,[00:33] <gonzalo_> Hello, can somebody help me install USB drivers for an Android LG Optimus One cellphone on an Ubuntu 11.04 computer?? Thanks!
0,[00:33] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, The Nightowl is configured to connect via PPPOE?
0,[00:33] <sooth> hiexpo: There must be a deb package
0,[00:33] <GiNeeRiNG> yes that is how i am configuring it
0,[00:34] <GiNeeRiNG> it is a dsl 2wire
0,[00:34] <sooth> hiexpo: I would be surprised if it wasn't in the official repos but I can't find it
0,[00:34] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, So you're connecting the Nightowl directly to a bridged DSL modem?
0,[00:34] <ubuntu-usr> join #videolan
0,[00:34] <GiNeeRiNG> right
0,[00:35] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, Hmm, is there a monitor attached to the Nightowl and an IR remote you can use to configure it?
0,[00:35] <gonzalo_> Hello, where can I find drivers for an LG Optimus One cellphone on Ubuntu 11.04??

0,[00:36] <GiNeeRiNG> Kron, yes that is how i am configuring it
0,[00:36] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, There should be somewhere in the menus where you can find out what IP address you were assigned, assuming the PPPOE login was successful
0,[00:37] <GiNeeRiNG> login still says connecting
0,[00:37] <Omega> GiNeeRiNG: add both a primary and a secondary dns server
0,[00:37] <GiNeeRiNG> only one area
0,[00:38] <Omega> try 008.008.008.008 as the dns server
0,[00:38] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, I can't think of anything that the Night Owl would do that would require DNS and DNS definitely isn't required to make the PPPOE login work
0,[00:38] <Omega> that's the google public dns server ip address

1,[00:40] <cbillJ> is it possible to switch to unity2d without logging out? i want to switch to unity2d when im using a vnc connection
0,[00:40] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, I'm trying to understand how you're connecting. Only one device should be doing the PPPOE login. If you're DSL modem is configured to function as a router as well, it is probably already doing the PPPOE login.
0,[00:41] <jimmybrite> oops *wrong keyboard" i should really plug in my kvm switch lol
0,[00:41] <low_cpu> okey
0,[00:41] <GiNeeRiNG> right, i have the dvr plugged into the network
0,[00:41] <gonzalo_> Hello, where can I find drivers for an LG Optimus One cellphone on Ubuntu 11.04?
0,[00:41] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, So there are other devices on the network?
0,[00:41] <GiNeeRiNG> yes
0,[00:41] <GiNeeRiNG> should i try static?
0,[00:42] <low_cpu> there is any mirrors for the ubuntu release ? cuz it's seem's to be slow ?
0,[00:42] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, Gotcha. Then you're not connecting it to a bridged DSL model ;)
0,[00:42] <deviantgeek> should i go with 32-bit or 64-bit ubuntu? i have 6 GB memory, and an intel i7 950
0,[00:42] <Deamos> 64 bit ubuntu
0,[00:42] <cbillJ> deviantgeek 64
0,[00:42] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, Ideally it should probably be configured with a static. If you're going to want to allow people to connect to it from the web you're going to have to set up port forwards in the router
0,[00:42] <gregL> gonzalo_, did you plug it in and see if it was recognized?
0,[00:42] <itaylor57> deviantgeek: 128
0,[00:42] <deviantgeek> low_cpu: you can torrent it
0,[00:42] <itaylor57> deviantgeek: 64
0,[00:42] <low_cpu> ok tnk's
0,[00:43] <GiNeeRiNG> right.
0,[00:43] <gonzalo_> gregL: The phone recognized it was plugged in, but no icon appeared on the Ubuntu desktop
0,[00:43] <GiNeeRiNG> for another day then, for another day.
0,[00:43] <deviantgeek> gonzalo_: did you put it in USB drive mode?
0,[00:43] <GiNeeRiNG> damn doing this for a job, this shit sucks =D
0,[00:44] <syrinx_> GiNeeRiNG: still didn't get it?
0,[00:44] <gonzalo_> deviantgeek: I did't do anything special, so probably not
0,[00:44] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, You'll need to assign it an address that doesn't conflict with the range being assigned by DHCP
0,[00:44] <gregL> gonzalo_, Did you look under places and see if it was recognized,but not mounted
0,[00:45] <gonzalo_> gregL: I'll both ideas right away
0,[00:45] <low_cpu> what's the difference between 11.04 and 11.04.02 ??
0,[00:46] <Kron> GiNeeRiNG, Do you know how the private LAN is configured?
0,[00:47] <Cerda> whats the best option in your opinion guys to convert a movie dvd to an .avi file?? thanks !!
0,[00:47] <IdleOne> low_cpu: where did you see 11.04.02?
0,[00:47] <low_cpu> http://releases.ubuntu.com/10.04.2/
0,[00:47] <syrinx_> that says 10.04.2
0,[00:47] <low_cpu> yes ^^''
0,[00:48] <IdleOne> well that isn't 11.04 it's 10.04.2 the .2 is a point release it includes all updates that where applied since the release
0,[00:48] <low_cpu> are 11.04 not LTS ??
0,[00:48] <IdleOne> no
0,[00:48] <DocPlatypus> low_cpu: LTS is once every two years, next will be 12.04
1,[00:49] <cbillJ> Can you switch to unity2d without logging out?
1,[00:49] <syrinx_> nope
0,[00:49] <cbillJ> gah
0,[00:49] <low_cpu> ^^''
0,[00:49] <low_cpu> tnks
0,[00:50] <gonzalo_> gregL: How do I look in Places to see if it was recognized?
0,[00:51] <syrinx_> gonzalo_: the places menu on the top panel
0,[00:51] <Nexxy> Omega: thanks for your help ;3 I fixed it somehow just with -f
1,[00:51] <gonzalo_> syrinx_: I am using the new Unity interface... Places is no longer there...
0,[00:51] <syrinx_> ah
0,[00:51] <syrinx_> sorry then
0,[00:51] <plustax> Im running 11.04 and I click dropbox but it wont open
0,[00:51] <gregL> gonzalo_, no clue I am not using 11.04,sorry
0,[00:51] <plustax> it was working before, I restarted. But it's not showing up
0,[00:51] <Nexxy> thanks guys <3
0,[00:52] <gonzalo_> gregL: And is there an equivalent to "My Computer"?
0,[00:52] <Somelauw> places/computer ?
0,[00:53] <gregL> gonzalo_, Yes, It would have been under Places..
0,[00:53] <gonzalo_> gregL: oops... I'll look
0,[00:53] <jimmybrite> i just followed the grub2 chroot method and I still get "error: no such device, error: no such disk, error: you need to load the kernel first" im at my wits end, am I gonna need to restore the win7 bootloader and erase all my ext partitions for 11.04 to boot?
0,[00:55] <chille> i just rebootet my new ubuntu box for the first time and now it can't find the root partition :(
0,[00:55] <jimmybrite> welcome to my world
0,[00:55] <gonzalo_> gregL: I opened any folder and I found an icon at the top that looks like a computer... that opened My Computer. I see LGE Android Device.
0,[00:55] <chille> i bootet up the ubuntu live cd and ran fdisk /dev/sda and it says:
0,[00:55] <chille> /dev/sda1               1      243202  1953514583+  ee  GPT
0,[00:55] <jimmybrite> funny thing is I had 11.04 installed in the alpha stage, but it was with grub-legacy at least grub legacy worked
0,[00:56] <chille> but how do i know what partitions are inside the GPT?
0,[00:56] <escott> chille, gdisk
0,[00:56] <gregL> gonzalo_, you should be able to right click and choose mount..
0,[00:56] <deviantgeek> holy, just downloaded ubuntu 11.04 in 2 minutes
0,[00:56] <escott> chille, you could also try gparted
0,[00:57] <Kron> deviantgeek, Bittorrent I assume?
0,[00:57] <deviantgeek> Kron: yeah
0,[00:57] <deviantgeek> 7.0 mb download speed
0,[00:57] <gonzalo_> gregL: Sadly, there is no option to mount. My cellphone is asking me to "Turn on USB storage"
0,[00:58] <gonzalo_> gregL: However, I don't want to use it as a mass storage device.
0,[00:58] <gregL> gonzalo_, What are you trying to do?
0,[00:58] <gonzalo_> gregL: But at least now I know it was recognized, so thanks!
0,[00:59] <gonzalo_> gregL: I have Eclipse installed with Android Development Kit
0,[00:59] <gonzalo_> gregL: And I want to load a HelloWorld Android App onto my cellphone
0,[00:59] <gregL> gonzalo_, Ok good luck..Glad I could help a bit..

0,[01:02] <antihero> Hi, I want to upgrade to openssl 1.0 because it has a hashing algorithm I want to use in Python. I've got a stow'd version ready, but if I try and remove the openssl and libssl-dev packages, it wants to remove a load of other things. Can I remove those packages without removing the other stuff?
0,[01:04] <DJJeff> having issues with Ath AR5001 says its disabled here is output of lsmod and lspci
0,[01:04] <Jon30> Hi, I wanna install VirtualBox which is 32bit application, would I benefit from installing 64 OS in the virtualbox?
0,[01:04] <DJJeff> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Xevq9Ttj
0,[01:04] <escott> Jon30, no but you would if the host is 64bit
0,[01:05] <escott> Jon30, i suspect you cant run a 64bit guest on a 32bit host
0,[01:05] <aplund> emulation maybe
0,[01:06] <Calif> Anyone familiar with isc-dhcp-server ?

0,[01:06] <aplund> mencoder
0,[01:07] <jimmybrite> i just followed the grub2 chroot method and I still get "error: no such device, error: no such disk, error: you need to load the kernel first" im at my wits end, I don't know what else to do, except install grub 0.97
0,[01:07] <Kron> Jon30, Why wouldn't you just install the 64-bit version of Virtualbox?
0,[01:08] <toneshifter> sup all
0,[01:08] <toneshifter> :)
0,[01:08] <escott> jimmybrite, check your boot commands sounds like it found an initrd but not a kernel
0,[01:08] <lapion> DJJeff, try rfkill
0,[01:09] <DJJeff> rfkill [options] command ??
0,[01:09] <lapion> rfkill list
0,[01:09] <Jon30> Kron, is there a 64bit version of virtualbox/
0,[01:09] <DJJeff>         Soft blocked: no
0,[01:09] <DJJeff>         Hard blocked: yes
0,[01:10] <lapion> this is used to bock/unblock rf-card ( wifi/bluetooth etc etc)
0,[01:10] <aplund> Gees I hope 11.04 doesn't regress suspend/resume support on my machine
0,[01:10] <jimmybrite> <escott> it hasn't found squat, after reinstalling grub2 in a live cd env, I now do not have windows 7 listed
0,[01:10] <Kron> Jon30, http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads has packages for 32-bit and 64-bit
0,[01:10] <lapion> DJJeff, I think your card has a switch, or maybe a bios switch
0,[01:10] <toneshifter> yellow all i have a quick question if someone deleted some files (have no idea which ones) and after that grub shows only windows partition + memtest (believe that fstab was modified in some way) but most of the files are still on the disk and fdisk shows all partitions is it possible to fix that by adding missing files (kinde like a installation but adding missing files) ?
0,[01:10] <DJJeff> ok
0,[01:10] <escott> jimmybrite try and pastebin your grub.cfg and your partition layout
0,[01:11] <giacomo_c> it just occurred to me, i think i installed the x86 version of ubuntu instead of the x64, how can i find out which one i have?
0,[01:11] <Jon30> Kron actually I need the windows version, i think they only got the 32bit for windows
0,[01:11] <Kron> Jon30, My bad. I assumed you were installing it on Linux since we're in the Ubuntu channel ;)
0,[01:12] <jimmybrite> thisis unbelievable, I can install 10.10 no problem and the bootloader works, as soon as I put 11.04 it messes up everything, then what I do is I re install 10.10, I do a format of my ext4 partition and it works, but 11.04 is giving me such headaches
0,[01:12] <Jon30> Yea, on windows channel they don't know much :P
0,[01:12] <chille> okay guys, i didn't try gparted, but however i was able to mount the root filesystem from the live cd
0,[01:12] <Kron> Jon30, haha Though the Windows binary will install on 32 or 64 bit
0,[01:12] <chille> so the root partitions seems to be OK
0,[01:12] <BlaDe^> Can I search a directory recursively for the most recent edited files?
0,[01:12] <chille> and fsck says its okay
0,[01:12] <lapion> DJJeff, try to either find the switch, either a physical switch or one in the bios, and change it. Or use rfkill to unblock it.
0,[01:12] <antihero> Why does ubuntu still  not have openssl 1.x
0,[01:12] <escott> chille you have something called gpt with a mbr protective partition
0,[01:12] <DJJeff> here is a physical switch but no light came on
0,[01:12] <toneshifter> antihero just install ?
0,[01:13] <chille> but the GUID seems to have changed since installning Ubuntu, so the root partition isn't found while booting
0,[01:13] <jimmybrite> <DJJeff> ok
0,[01:13] <jimmybrite> <escott> jimmybrite try and pastebin your grub.cfg and your partition layout, i cant even do that, im stuck at the grub menu, id have to reboot with a live cd gimme a min
0,[01:13] <FoolsRun> Hello, I tried to install GRUB onto a secondary (soon to be primary if I can make it work) hard drive, but now trying to boot to that drive I get "GRUB GRUB GRUB GRUB GRUB GRUB GRUB" infinity. Help?
0,[01:13] <chille> should i try configuring the bootloader with the other GUID?
0,[01:13] <antihero> toneshifter: The one in apt is 0.9.x, to install 1.x you have to do it manually which breaks deps
0,[01:13] <badbandit> hello, I updated to 11.04 and now when I run skype, it does not show up in the top right and thus I dont know how to access/close it
0,[01:13] <badbandit> I am using classic view
0,[01:13] <Jon30> Kron: sure 32bit will install can be installed on either, but it won't run 64bit OS
0,[01:13] <antihero> I'm trying with stow now.
0,[01:14] <chille> ah... whatever.. i'll try
0,[01:14] <chille> brb
0,[01:14] <lapion> DJJeff, after changing the physical switch try using rfkill to unblock the hardware switch
0,[01:14] <toneshifter> antihero are there any known issues at 1.x ?
0,[01:14] <giacomo_c> how can i see which if i have the x86 or the x64 version of ubuntu installed?
0,[01:14] <tydeas> Can some uname -r on an ubuntu 11.04 and feed me with the result?

0,[01:15] <toneshifter> so just install that manually

0,[01:16] <toneshifter> try it :)
0,[01:16] <SLruan> swap turned ext4 by itself I don't know why
0,[01:16] <Donkey> hello !
0,[01:16] <toneshifter> do backupp
0,[01:16] <DJJeff> I may have just timed out from freenode lapion did you say anything?
0,[01:17] <tydeas> Is the ubuntu 11.04 shipped with kernel 2.6.38 ?
0,[01:17] <toneshifter> and go :)
0,[01:17] <Donkey> i just installed 11.04, and the bootloader failed to install, what are my options ?
0,[01:17] <tydeas> Donkey: reinstall
0,[01:17] <toneshifter> SLruan ? swap on ext4 ?
0,[01:17] <lapion> hanasaki, since vnc does a remote keybaord, the keyboard control goes to the remote pc and cnot control the vnc application, in the middle of the top of the display there should be a hidden menu
0,[01:17] <toneshifter> :X
0,[01:17] <toneshifter> Donkey reinstal grub
0,[01:17] <arand_> tydeas: 38-8 currently it seems
0,[01:17] <SLruan> swap become ext4
0,[01:17] <extor> my laptop keeps freezing at "activiating swap" and when I hit ctrl+C it moves forward to the next step but freezes yet again. What do?
0,[01:17] <hanasaki> lapion:  thanks
0,[01:17] <SLruan> when i restart computer
0,[01:17] <tydeas> arand_: seems ?
0,[01:17] <lapion> DJJeff, after changing the physical switch try using rfkill to unblock the hardware switch
0,[01:17] <toneshifter> or check update-grub :)
0,[01:17] <arand_> Donkey: Reinstall bootloader from liveCD
0,[01:17] <DJJeff> I did find this file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ath_pci.conf
0,[01:18] <toneshifter> extor do you have swap partition at all ? :P
0,[01:18] <DJJeff> how would I use rfkill to unblock it?
0,[01:18] <extor> toneshifter, yes and this has worked for months and months
0,[01:18] <Donkey> how do i reinstall grub?
0,[01:18] <tydeas> Donkey: google
0,[01:18] <arand_> tydeas: Don't know if there have been kernel updates to 38-9 or so lately, but yeah
0,[01:18] <lapion> DJJeff, if lsmod shows you some ath card has been loaded don't worry about the blacklistsd
0,[01:18] <toneshifter> hmmm check fdisk
0,[01:18] <tydeas> Donkey: do you need step by stepd guide?
0,[01:18] <Donkey> thanks, ive googled it, but i dont understand much of what i've found.
0,[01:18] <toneshifter> maybe the partition table got fucked up
0,[01:19] <extor> it mounts read only
0,[01:19] <tydeas> Donkey: why is that?
0,[01:19] <extor> should I boot in knoppix?
0,[01:19] <Donkey> im trying another installation of the whole thing, ill see if it works
0,[01:19] <toneshifter> extor what mounts read only ?
0,[01:19] <tydeas> Donkey: linux is not windows :)

0,[01:19] <extor> toneshifter, root
0,[01:19] <toneshifter> you can always use ntfs-3g to write
0,[01:19] <tydeas> Donkey: I am pretty sure you can install grub from live cd
0,[01:19] <Donkey> ok
0,[01:19] <james_> can someone give me a link on how to downgrade from 11.04?
0,[01:20] <toneshifter> extor just chroot to your system
0,[01:20] <antihero> hell, I guess I can remove and add openssl again
0,[01:20] <antihero> if it destroys everything
0,[01:20] <tydeas> Donkey: how many years are you using ubuntu or other linux distro?
0,[01:20] <antihero> dim sum time

0,[01:20] <PappaSmurf> I'm tring to setup dhcpd. I've installed DHCP 4.2.1-P1 but can't seem to start or even find the service, is there a way to list installed but not running services?
0,[01:20] <Donkey> still alot of stuff i cant figure out
0,[01:20] <Cheese> I need some help real quick
0,[01:20] <jimmybrite> http://pastebin.com/G2DfykM7 ----   my grub2 cfg file
0,[01:20] <james_> usr13: okay, thank you
0,[01:20] <bible-boy> can i install a new interface like KDE to use on 11.04 instead of Gnome
0,[01:20] <kaushal> I am using TB 3.1.8, I format the message in gedit and when i paste it on the compose window and send it , the lines get dealigned when i receive the email, Any Clue ?
0,[01:21] <usr13> PappaSmurf: You mean dhcpd?
0,[01:21] <extor> Ok I was able to recover by reseating the hard drive on the lappy
0,[01:21] <toneshifter> btw is it any way to find out which files were deleted and just add missing files at "reinstallation"
0,[01:21] <Donkey> it seems to me i wasted my youths sponge learning days with a POS os..
0,[01:21] <tydeas> arand: latest stable kernel version is 2.6.38.5
0,[01:21] <TomRone> bible-boy, you thinking about lxde?
0,[01:21] <PappaSmurf> yes
0,[01:21] <PappaSmurf> dhcpd
0,[01:21] <lapion> DJJeff, have you checked out the man page of rfkill ?
0,[01:21] <toneshifter> dont really feal like reinstaling 10.10 and update to 11.04
0,[01:21] <bible-boy> idk
0,[01:21] <toneshifter> ?
0,[01:21] <tydeas> what make you think it is shipped with an 38.8
0,[01:21] <extor> Donkey, which OS was that?
0,[01:21] <bible-boy> something better than gnome
0,[01:21] <usr13> PappaSmurf: It should already be running, but you just have to fill in your network info in the config file
0,[01:21] <tjiggi_fo> bible-boy, of course, you think kubuntu and xubuntu just stopped being?
0,[01:21] <Donkey> well, most of what windows made before vista..
0,[01:21] <DJJeff> No manual entry for rfkill
0,[01:21] <Cheese> Im installing fedora with  windows and ubuntu, and the windows partition is taking up all the free space. I have tons of freespace on the windows partition, so if i shrhink the windows partition, will it automatically make a new partition with the free space?
0,[01:21] <bible-boy> well i need ubuntu to use wubi
0,[01:22] <extor> same here
0,[01:22] <Donkey> i just couldnt stand learning another windows so i switched
0,[01:22] <toneshifter> wubi sucks :):D
0,[01:22] <extor> except I messed with slackware for a while on the side
0,[01:22] <bible-boy> well im just a kid
0,[01:22] <lapion> DJJeff, try : man rfkill
0,[01:22] <bible-boy> im not messin with partitions
0,[01:22] <TomRone> bible-boy, careful how you say better with gnome...its a matter of preference
0,[01:22] <toneshifter> installing ubu to file on a fragmented disk
0,[01:22] <DJJeff> yes I did says there is none
0,[01:22] <bible-boy> ok
0,[01:22] <toneshifter> sucks :)
0,[01:22] <DJJeff> root@ubuntu:~# man rfkill
0,[01:22] <Cheese> Anyone can just answer this real quick?
1,[01:23] <bible-boy> wish i could use Unity
0,[01:23] <tjiggi_fo> bible-boy, download kubuntu and try it on a live CD and if you have enough CD's tru xubuntu too
0,[01:23] <toneshifter> bible-boy it depends what you like, lxde, xfce, kde, icewm
0,[01:23] <toneshifter> and whatever you want :)
1,[01:23] <bible-boy> i like unity
0,[01:23] <usr13> PappaSmurf: /etc/dhcpd.conf
0,[01:23] <TomRone> bible-boy, if you want to try more customizeable things theres fluxbox, openbox and then there is xubuntu and lubuntu
0,[01:23] <Cheese> D:
0,[01:23] <Donkey> maybe if i had got into that 10 years earlier i'd be right here helping the newbies
0,[01:23] <Cheese>  Im installing fedora with  windows and ubuntu, and the windows partition is taking up all the free space. I have tons of freespace on the windows partition, so if i shrhink the windows partition, will it automatically make a new partition with the free space?
0,[01:23] <PappaSmurf> ok I'll give it a look
0,[01:23] <PappaSmurf> thanks
0,[01:23] <usr13> PappaSmurf: you should find the scirpt to start and stop in /etc/init.d/
0,[01:23] <bible-boy> well i already have ubuntu so im not installing a new os
0,[01:24] <Donkey> ive heard that back in the days you guys had no graphic interface
1,[01:24] <bible-boy> anything else like unity that i can use on 11.04
1,[01:24] <bible-boy> cause  i like unity
0,[01:24] <TomRone> bible-boy, install fluxbox desktop environment with synaptic and give that a shot or lxde perhaps. you use the login manager to choose which environment to use
0,[01:24] <usr13> Are you going to turn off the dhcp server on your   existing router?
0,[01:24] <Cheese> Plox!!!
0,[01:24] <Donkey> whats a computer like when you cant see what you're doing
1,[01:25] <lapion> bible-boy, why can't you use unity ?
0,[01:25] <bible-boy> where can i download that because i have it installed on a pc without internet. Right now im running Ubutnu off a live cd
0,[01:25] <tydeas> Is there anyone with ubuntu 11.04 to PLEASE pastebin the `uname -r` result.
0,[01:25] <Cheese> will shrinking a partition automatically get rid of the free space?
1,[01:25] <bible-boy> oh i cant use it because i only have 512mb memory
0,[01:25] <Donkey> woohoo
0,[01:25] <Donkey> instalation worked !
0,[01:25] <Cheese> Will it automatically get rid of the free space in the partition?
0,[01:25] <usr13> PappaSmurf: Are you going to turn off the dhcp server on your   existing router?
0,[01:25] <PappaSmurf> In /etc I have dhcp & dhcp3 no dhcpd files
0,[01:25] <Donkey> tydeas : hold on im rebooting
0,[01:26] <tydeas> Donkey: thanks soulmate
0,[01:26] <usr13> PappaSmurf: It's probably in dhcp3
1,[01:26] <bible-boy> so anything else like unity
0,[01:26] <trism> tydeas: arand already told to it is 2.6.38-8, -9 doesn't have a package yet
0,[01:26] <ZykoticK9> .
0,[01:26] <PappaSmurf> I will be setting up an independent dhcp server
0,[01:27] <Cheese>  -.- i know someone here could just say yes or no
1,[01:27] <bible-boy> so anything like unity
0,[01:27] <PappaSmurf> I'm just learning how bind works
1,[01:27] <bible-boy> with the launcher an stuff
0,[01:27] <usr13> PappaSmurf: did you install dhcp3-server
0,[01:27] <usr13> ?
0,[01:27] <antihero> Grr, just got 1.0.0d installed but it still doesn't show the whirlpool digest
1,[01:27] <ZykoticK9> bible-boy, the only think "like" unity is Gnome3 - don't go there!
0,[01:27] <bible-boy> well how bout` this
0,[01:27] <TomRone> bible-boy, idk if gnome shell runs without graphics or not...but thats another environment to try
0,[01:27] <jimmybrite> http://pastebin.com/G2DfykM7 ----   my grub2 cfg file - 10.10 installs and dual boots fine, 11.04 breaks my mbr, I reinstalled grub2 from live cd and now win7 is not even listed in the grub config, and nothing boots
0,[01:27] <PappaSmurf> I don't think so
0,[01:27] <bible-boy> ok than
0,[01:27] <lapion> bible-boy, with only 51mb you should be installing extra ram or stick to lxde or something and search for an appropriate theme
0,[01:28] <Donkey> tydeas : 2.6.38-8-generic
0,[01:28] <tydeas> Donkey: thanks
0,[01:28] <bible-boy>  well like i said before im a kid i cant go buy more memory and my dad`s not gonna lety me either
0,[01:28] <TomRone> lapion, bible-boy , yeah if you have light specs use lubuntu or install lxde
0,[01:28] <trism> tydeas: no I take it back, -9 appears to be in proposed
1,[01:28] <bible-boy> well what i want is the launcher
0,[01:29] <PappaSmurf> I have been asked by my lecturer to go and find a dhcpd package and install.... ummm yeah great
0,[01:29] <usr13> PappaSmurf: What did you install?
0,[01:29] <bible-boy> are there any programs like Rocket dock for windows.
1,[01:29] <TomRone> bible-boy, you prolly not gonna have the system resources to run things as big as the unity launcher. lxde is like old gnome without gfx stuff
0,[01:29] <PappaSmurf> DHCP 4.2.1-P1
0,[01:29] <Donkey> hey guys
0,[01:29] <Donkey> thanks alot
0,[01:29] <Donkey> you helped alot
0,[01:29] <Cheese>  Im installing fedora with  windows and ubuntu, and the windows partition is taking up all the free space. I have tons of freespace on the windows partition, so if i shrhink the windows partition, will it automatically make a new partition with the free space?
0,[01:30] <Cheese> or will it take up data for the partition
0,[01:30] <PappaSmurf> came up with errors so  I ran the make file with -ik
0,[01:30] <bible-boy> well i have enough memory to run rocket dock on windows, which is a launcher that looks like the mac dock
0,[01:30] <usr13> PappaSmurf: Choices are dhcp3-server  &  udhcpd
0,[01:30] <bible-boy> any kind of launcher
0,[01:30] <dsnyders> Cheese, No.  You have to resize another partition to claim that space or make a new one
0,[01:30] <bible-boy> will work
0,[01:30] <Cheese> k
1,[01:30] <Belial`> there has to be a way to get unity working. if i can do an upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 and everything works fine, there's no reason unity shouldn't be able to run on the same machine with a clean install.
0,[01:30] <PappaSmurf> righty ho
1,[01:30] <Belial`> but it isn't.
1,[01:31] <Belial`> does anyone know a fix for this?
0,[01:31] <bible-boy> so any programs l i can install
0,[01:31] <Cheese> is there anyway to shrink the partition within indows?
0,[01:31] <usr13> Cheese: Yes  -  gparted
0,[01:32] <Cheese> gparted?
0,[01:32] <TomRone> bible-boy, i found this app off arch forums as a light text completion launcher http://www.electricmonk.nl/Programmings/Gexec
0,[01:32] <bible-boy> ok ill look brb
0,[01:32] <TomRone> bible-boy, its not much but its text auto completion launcher not dock
0,[01:32] <Cheese> googld
0,[01:32] <lapion> Cheese, you can shrick any and all partitions using the partition manager gparted while booted from the ubuntu cd/dvd..
0,[01:32] <bible-boy> oh ill still look at it
0,[01:32] <lapion> many netsplits tonight
0,[01:33] <bible-boy> nah not what i want
0,[01:33] <Cheese> lapion: im using the fedora dvd, and it has the option to shirnk the partition. But im worried if i shrink the windows partition, i will lose data
0,[01:33] <jimmybrite> am I the only one in the world who can't get grub2 to work at all? this is really starting to infuriate me
0,[01:33] <dsnyders> Cheese, Always back up your important stuff before playing with partitions
0,[01:33] <PappaSmurf> Thanks usr13 I'll go check those pakages, I need to install on Fedora12 too I hope this wont be a problem
0,[01:34] <Cheese> dsnyders: i dont have anything to back it up on
0,[01:34] <Cheese> but then again i dont have anything tooo important
0,[01:34] <lapion> cheater_, the partition shrinker actually shrinks the partition, only if there is enough free spac
0,[01:34] <TomRone> bible-boy, check out http://xubuntu.org/ if you look at screenshot there is a panel/dock. xubuntu runs good on lighter resources, not as good as lxde but better than gnome
0,[01:34] <Cheese> except the windows program files.... which i cant risk losing
1,[01:34] <Guest70608> i lke dragging the application to the left or right of the window and it fills up the left or right side of the screen!  very fun!  (in unity)
0,[01:34] <lapion> sorry cheater_ that one was meant for Cheese
0,[01:34] <bible-boy> well on the net i found Kiba dock
0,[01:35] <dsnyders> Cheese, If you're really worried about it, there are freeware partition shrinkers that work in windows.
0,[01:35] <Cheese> lapion: i have plenty of free space in my windows partition. Do you think the fedora installation partition shrinker will only shrink the free space?
0,[01:36] <Cheese> lol "the fedora installation partition shrinker: XD
0,[01:36] <bible-boy> nope kiba wont work
0,[01:36] <lapion> Cheese, a programfile is the same as data if windows is not booted so make a backup before hand because anything can happen while shrinking, like power going off but no one can help that
0,[01:36] <TomRone> bible-boy, well good luck in your search, I think xubuntu or lxde might be your best alternative
0,[01:36] <dsnyders> Cheese, BTW, you are aware that this is an ubuntu support forum, right?
0,[01:36] <chille> in my partition table i have /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3 wich is root partition and swap, but what is /dev/sda1?
0,[01:36] <Cheese> its a laptop, is power the only think i have to worry about? or will the device that shrinks the partition start deleting files?
0,[01:37] <Cheese> ok
0,[01:37] <bible-boy> well i just want he dock not the whole interface
0,[01:37] <chille> File system: unkown, Size: 977KiB
0,[01:37] <Cheese> Ill shrink the ubuntu partition then
0,[01:37] <Cheese> XD
0,[01:37] <lapion> Cheese, but if the partition is shrunk with power loss or something  you needen't worry about anything.
0,[01:37] <Braiam> chille: fdisk -l
0,[01:37] <lapion> Cheese, but if the partition is shrunk without power loss or something  you needen't worry about anything.
0,[01:37] <Captainkrtek> chille, you could install DSL on there ;-)
0,[01:37] <Cheese> ok ty
0,[01:37] <MK``> What files are kept in /boot?
0,[01:37] <Captainkrtek> MK``, boot files
0,[01:37] <Cheese> laptop is plugged in
0,[01:37] <derp> Can i run 32 bits ubuntu on a 64 bits computer?
0,[01:38] <Cheese> full battery
0,[01:38] <chille> Braiam: i have a GPT so i run GParted :o
0,[01:38] <syrinx_> derp: yes
0,[01:38] <MK``> Captainkrtek: like grub?...
0,[01:38] <Captainkrtek> derp, yes but you won't be able to use 64 bit features
0,[01:38] <Captainkrtek> MK``, yes
0,[01:38] <Captainkrtek> MK``, I think /boot/grub ?
0,[01:38] <Cheese> is there a certain power i need to size the partition to? or can it be any random number
0,[01:38] <chille> hmm.. sda1 have a bios_grub flag :o
0,[01:39] <MK``> Captainkrtek: so if I want to have 2 separate distributions installed, would they share a /boot partition?
0,[01:39] <zenocon> where is xorg.conf in 11.04?
0,[01:39] <Captainkrtek> MK``, no, you'd have two seperate partitions
0,[01:39] <dsnyders> Cheese, It's up to you, but leave a few gig of free space for Windows
0,[01:39] <Captainkrtek> each with their own /boot
0,[01:40] <AaeRohn> hello peoples, I am back with more compatibility stuffs I would like solved... One is for an Adobe Vistablet, and the other is for League Of Legends... can anyone help with either
0,[01:40] <ZykoticK9> zenocon, same place as in 10.04 / 10.10 - not there by default
0,[01:40] <l3> Hi All: After my upgrade to 11.04 ifconfig shows only loopback device, no eth0 or wlan :(
0,[01:40] <MK``> Captainkrtek: so I'd have to manually select which partition to run grub from?
0,[01:40] <Captainkrtek> MK``, grub auto makes the bootup table where you select that partition to boot to
0,[01:40] <lapion> Cheese,  it's up to you you need at least 10Gb for each linux installation
0,[01:40] <derp> thanks sylvestre_ho
0,[01:40] <derp> syrinx_
0,[01:40] <Cheese> Yea ik. Also, the reason why i am on ubuntu suport IRC... Will grub still be my default boot manager? after installin fedora?
0,[01:41] <Captainkrtek> Cheese, fedora will overwrite whatever you have as your bootloader and remap ubuntu, not sure what it uses though
0,[01:41] <zenocon> zykotick9: i need to enable SHM for input device - everything indicates do that thru xorg.config.  not sure how to proceed
0,[01:41] <Captainkrtek> could be grub
0,[01:41] <MK``> I think I will need to test this out myself so I don't have 1000 questions heh
0,[01:41] <l3> Can anyone help me figure out how to diagnose why ifconfig would not show my network cards?
0,[01:41] <Captainkrtek> MK``, heh
0,[01:41] <bible-boy> i found Sim dock, ill think ill use that
0,[01:41] <ZykoticK9> Cheese, fedora (even 15 i believe) will install grub1 (grub-legacy) and probably not find your ubuntu install :(  Good luck.
0,[01:41] <Captainkrtek> l3, hold on
0,[01:41] <Cheese> will fedoras boot manager pick up windows and ubuntu
0,[01:41] <bible-boy> oh while im here
0,[01:41] <aplund> l3 - dmesg ?
0,[01:41] <Captainkrtek> l3, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide
0,[01:41] <bible-boy> how do i access ubuntu`s antivirus
0,[01:41] <Captainkrtek> follow that guide
0,[01:41] <ZykoticK9> zenocon, it is possible to generate an Xorg.conf that you can then edit
0,[01:41] <Azelphur> bible-boy: Ubuntu doesn't have/needo ne
0,[01:41] <AaeRohn> hello peoples, I am back with more compatibility stuffs I would like solved... One is for an Adobe Vistablet, and the other is for League Of Legends... can anyone help with either
0,[01:42] <dsnyders> Cheese, It depends on the installer.  If it doesn't autodetect them, you can still add them manually.
0,[01:42] <jimmybrite> why does 10.10 install/runs perfectly on a dual boot machine (1 physical disk) but 11.04 doesn't even boot at all? http://pastebin.com/G2DfykM7 - this is grub.cfg AFTER the chroot fix on help.ubuntu.com ? what should I do, please I really want 11.04 (sandy bridge cpu/gpu+11.04 = niceness with minecraft)
0,[01:42] <lapion> and I am afk
0,[01:42] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: got wine?
0,[01:42] <bible-boy> i thought it siad it came with one built into 11.04
0,[01:42] <jesse_> Hi, I am trying to file a bug against kernel-ppa/mainline but it appears this is impossible
0,[01:42] <Cheese> Alright... But if it doesnt detect them, how do i access the operating systems that it does not detect?
0,[01:42] <jesse_> ubuntu-bug does not let me file the bug because I am running a mainline kernel
0,[01:42] <zarbula> Ubuntu, Just put a PCI x-fi card I had around, works but it makes this static noise every 6 secs or so.  Any clues how to troubleshoot that?
0,[01:42] <syrinx_> Azelphur: A nice "port" maybe? 0_o
0,[01:42] <AaeRohn> Azelphur: yes, but LoL doesnt even start
0,[01:42] <Azelphur> bible-boy: not that I know of, there is no need/use for one unless your scanning windows machines
0,[01:43] <bible-boy> it does on the site it says built in virus protection
0,[01:43] <jesse_> But the bug is that ppa mainline has been failing to build for the past two weeks
0,[01:43] <Azelphur> bible-boy: link?
0,[01:43] <jimmybrite> I had 11.04 at some point through the proposed/experimental updates, but it was with the old grub
0,[01:43] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: what's your wine --version ?
0,[01:43] <bible-boy> http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
0,[01:43] <ZykoticK9> !virus | bible-boy
0,[01:43] <ubottu> bible-boy: Antivirus is something you don't need on !Linux. except where files are then passed to windows computers (perhaps using samba), See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus
0,[01:43] <Azelphur> bible-boy: so it does, that's interesting
0,[01:43] <dsnyders> Cheese, You'd have to know where they boot from.  However, that sort of question would be better asked in a Fedora forum, as it is the fedora installer that would be doing the work.
0,[01:43] <bible-boy> o yeah but there are viruses, they are just rare
0,[01:43] <jesse_> This is clearly an Ubuntu bug, the build log has failed every day since April 20
0,[01:43] <jesse_> http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.39-rc4-oneiric/BUILD.LOG
0,[01:43] <Azelphur> bible-boy: I'm going to look into that, that's a weird statement
0,[01:43] <Cheese> Alright
0,[01:44] <AaeRohn> Azelphur: 1.2.2
0,[01:44] <Cheese> is dev/sda2 an example of where one would boot from?
0,[01:45] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: your using a very old version of wine. Uninstall the version you have (Your installed files will remain after uninstalling the wine package don't worry) and use these instructions http://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu then try again
0,[01:45] <Captainkrtek> bible-boy, they are VERY rare, linux's userbase is small compared to windows, making us a small target. Plus Linux has very good security inplace
0,[01:45] <ZykoticK9> Cheese, perhaps?  /dev/sda2 is the second partition on the first hard drive - only you can say what is located there, different for everyone
0,[01:45] <jimmybrite> i'm guessing that my issue is so out of the ordinary that no one has a fix for it? (grub2 = mbr kaput so I reinstall 10.10 to get my mbr+grub menu back)
0,[01:45] <bible-boy> ok then
0,[01:45] <syrinx_> bible-boy, Azelphur linux doesn't get viruses :/
0,[01:45] <Azelphur> syrinx_: no I'm more interested in why the download page says there is built in virus protection
0,[01:45] <bible-boy> yes it does just they are rare
0,[01:45] <Azelphur> and exactly what protection they are referring to
0,[01:45] <Azelphur> I think bible-boy thinks the same xD
0,[01:45] <aplund> built in virus protection by design
0,[01:45] <Captainkrtek> lol
0,[01:45] <aplund> but not complete immunity
0,[01:45] <zenocon> so what is used instead of xorg.conf?
0,[01:45] <jimmybrite> ok, so im gonna re-install 10.10 for the 100th time, OR should I erase all my ext/swap partitions , then fix the win7 mbr, THEN try 11.04 again??
0,[01:45] <syrinx_> because the average user that is migrating over to linux won't believe you when you tell them that "linux doesn't get viruses"
0,[01:46] <aplund> you cannot conrol what users end up doing
0,[01:46] <bible-boy> well thats all i needed to ask so, before i leave any questions for me
0,[01:46] <ZykoticK9> zenocon, automatic configuration
0,[01:46] <Azelphur> aplund: that would be resistance rather than protection
0,[01:46] <Azelphur> maybe a wording fail on the website, I dunno
0,[01:46] <multipass_> hi, is there any way to rollback the compiz fusion changes from 11.04 back to 10.10... edge flipping broke and it was core :O
0,[01:46] <aplund> you can be protected but without completely being immune
0,[01:46] <bible-boy> welli have to leave now bye
0,[01:46] <aplund> like windows protect you from falling out of a buildling
0,[01:47] <Azelphur> bible-boy: cya, I'm still gonna find out what that statement means :P
0,[01:47] <AaeRohn> I would also like help getting my pen tablet to work properly
0,[01:47] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: #ubuntu-touch can probably help you with that
0,[01:47] <Azelphur> (I think that's the channel name, anyway)
0,[01:47] <Cheese> Reinstallation of grub2 would work though right?
0,[01:48] <syrinx_> !touch
0,[01:48] <syrinx_> nop
0,[01:48] <jimmybrite> <Cheese> not for me
0,[01:48] <ZykoticK9> Cheese, yes and reinstalling Ubuntu's Grub2 "should" find Fedora
0,[01:48]  * jimmybrite is frustrated, grrr
0,[01:48] <Cheese> I could reinstall grub using a live cd, no?
0,[01:48] <ZykoticK9> !grub2 > Cheese
0,[01:48] <ubottu> Cheese, please see my private message
0,[01:49] <Cheese> Ok ty
0,[01:49] <ZykoticK9> Cheese, several options
0,[01:50] <lwizardl> if i have a ubuntu system that i lost the password to the user account. can i use a live cd to change it ?
0,[01:50] <aplund> just boot into single user mode
0,[01:50] <Glycan> Argh
0,[01:50] <aplund> then "passwd username"
0,[01:50] <aplund> (I think)
0,[01:50] <Glycan> Help!
0,[01:50] <ZykoticK9> !lostpassword | lwizardl
0,[01:50] <ubottu> lwizardl: Forgot your password? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal.

0,[01:51] <AaeRohn> Azelphur: not letting me install Wine 1.3
0,[01:51] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: did you uninstall the old wine like I told you?
0,[01:51] <AaeRohn> Azelphur: yes
0,[01:51] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: put the error your getting on pastebin.com
0,[01:51] <Glycan> How d I change boot loader without anything but PhonixBIOS and BusyBox from a not-really-working livecd?
0,[01:51] <AaeRohn> Could not find package 'wine1.3'.
0,[01:52] <AaeRohn> Azelphur:
0,[01:52] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: sudo apt-get update
0,[01:52] <Ziber> So, I have ubuntu 10.10 on my laptop. Working fine earlier this afternoon, but when I tried to boot it up a few hours ago, load immediately went into the 4 range and the only thing I could actually do on it was open terminal and run 'top' (which showed nothing out of the ordinary). syslog said something about an 'i/o error', earlier.
0,[01:52] <Ziber> Booting it up again right now, taking rather long (seemed to freeze for several minutes at the boot screen). my desktop *just* loaded.
0,[01:53] <AaeRohn> Azelphur: alright, done
0,[01:53] <Ziber> running at loads of 3+ atm
0,[01:53] <AaeRohn> Azelphur: and installing
0,[01:53] <Ziber> when i try to open my home directory, it says "opening" at the bottom, but then that just disappears.
0,[01:53] <Glycan> Guys! For the love of eavrything holy and cool, HELP ME!
0,[01:54] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: :D
0,[01:54] <Ziber> any ideas are most welcome.
0,[01:54] <amybunny> If I'm inside a Xubuntu desktop booted from the cd in "try it out" mode, can I install Ubuntu Server edition that way?
0,[01:54] <amybunny> from the desktop
0,[01:54] <Cheese> Ok when i shrunk the partition to make the space. It automatically made a new partition called boot, right next to the fedora partition. If i delete that "Boot" partition do you think it would just use grub?
0,[01:54] <Glycan> I/my friend had Windows vista on a toshiba laptop. The screen broke, I took it from him, hooked it up to another screen, put U on it (11.04), the computer was very cluttered so I only put the gb partition, then when space became very tight I tryed cleaning the windows, deleted windows (didn't get my space back- How do you change partition borders?), then a while later when I rebooted, it tryed
0,[01:54] <Glycan> to poitn to windows (normally boot points to windows, and windows asks you what you want, and you go to ubuntu from there.), but most of windows wosn't there, so I can't get to U. A live CD I made only shows test console, and doesn't even let past the cd, I think. "BusyBox v1.17.1, build in shell (ash). How do I get to U?
0,[01:55] <yuskhanzab> is there any tutorial how to maintain my internet connection speed, bcoz my internet connection speed keep changing
0,[01:55] <Ziber> Ubuntu software center starts, but none of the 'places'.
0,[01:55] <ZykoticK9> amybunny, i don't think so - the server edition is not a live cd (or at least i don't think it is)
0,[01:55] <tensorpudding> Glycan: you can grow partitions, but only from a live nvironment
0,[01:55] <tensorpudding> Glycan: use gparted for that
0,[01:55] <yuskhanzab> i want it to maintain
0,[01:55] <tensorpudding> Glycan: are you using GRUB?
0,[01:56] <Ziber> syslog reports "i/o error, dev sda, sector 92107521"
0,[01:56] <aplund> that's not cool
0,[01:56] <FoolsRun> Hello, I definitely have this whole grub thing screwed up. Can anyone point me at a howto for installing GRUB on /dev/sdb while booted to /dev/sda ?
0,[01:56] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, failing HD most likely, I'd backup everything you can.
0,[01:56] <aplund> failing HD or HDD controler (I've had the latter)
0,[01:57] <escott> !grub | FoolsRun
0,[01:57] <ubottu> FoolsRun: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
0,[01:57] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: The majority of it is backed up. I recently had windows crash on me, so I made a complete backup a few weeks ago.
0,[01:57] <Ziber> is there a way to determine if its a failing HD or HDD controller?
0,[01:57] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, you could look into SMART to see if it tells you anything (but it's non-trivial to use)
0,[01:57] <Glycan> GUYS!!! FOR THE THIRD TIME: HELP!
0,[01:57] <FoolsRun> I'd love to boot to a LiveCD but this machine won't boot a bootable USB
0,[01:57] <amybunny> ZykoticK9, how feasable is a net install at the moment?
0,[01:57] <tensorpudding> Glycan: read what i wrote
0,[01:57] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: is that a package?
0,[01:57] <Glycan> Opps.
0,[01:58] <ZykoticK9> amybunny, ? dunno sorry
0,[01:58] <Glycan> GRUB?
0,[01:58] <Glycan> ?
0,[01:58] <tensorpudding> Glycan: yes
0,[01:58] <Glycan> Which is?
0,[01:58] <tensorpudding> Glycan: the bootloader
0,[01:58] <Glycan> Not sure.
0,[01:58] <tensorpudding> Glycan: it's the thing that lets you choose whether to start windows or ubuntu, presumably
0,[01:58] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, no SMART is a HD status function - i forget what the package(s) are called
0,[01:58] <Glycan> How would I know?
0,[01:58] <FoolsRun> Right now I have "GRUB GRUB GRUB GRUB GRUB GRUB GRUB" repeating to infinity on my screen
0,[01:58] <Glycan> Nothing does.
0,[01:58] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: Oddly, I am able to use terminal to browse my files.
0,[01:58] <Glycan> All I see is PoenixBIOS
0,[01:58] <tensorpudding> Glycan: hold down right shift after the BIOS is finished
0,[01:59]  * Ziber throughly rsync's his backup
0,[01:59] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, see http://www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/monitoring-hard-disks-smart for some guidance in using the CLI SMART program
0,[02:00] <escott> FoolsRun, repeating "GRUB" is apparently a failed attempt to read the root filesystem
0,[02:00] <zarbula> Ubuntu, Just put a PCI x-fi card I had around, works but it makes this static noise every 6 secs or so.  Any clues how to troubleshoot that?
0,[02:00] <FoolsRun> escott: would repairing GRUB with something like rescatux b elikely to fix that sort of thing?
0,[02:00] <Glycan> Wow. It stopped showing BIOS
0,[02:00] <escott> FoolsRun, I would follow the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub and restore grub to both mbrs
0,[02:01] <escott> FoolsRun, you have two disks right? what do you have on the mbr of disk 1
0,[02:01] <AaeRohn> Azelphur LoL still does not play
0,[02:01] <bison> what should i use in my nvidia card? proprietary or open source?
0,[02:01] <comthre3> Hi, can someone help me with an issue im facing with uShare? Im using 11.04 downloaded ushare from the repo, setup everything is fine and dandy. dlna option is turned on, my PS3 recognizes the uPnP i can also see the folders, but for some reason the server wont load the files. all the folders/subfolders are there, but the ps3 and my other upnp device shows no data. how can i solve this?
0,[02:01] <tensorpudding> Glycan: what do you see
0,[02:01] <FoolsRun> The 1st disk boots fine, actually
0,[02:01] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: I found the package. smartmontools.
0,[02:01] <FoolsRun> escott: the first disk boots fine actually
0,[02:01] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: check your wine --version
0,[02:01] <escott> FoolsRun, so you are switching the boot order in the bios
0,[02:02] <FoolsRun> escott: I cloned the 1st disk onto a second, but am so far unable to make it bootable.
0,[02:02] <AaeRohn> Azelphur 1.3
0,[02:02] <FoolsRun> escott: actually just unplugging the first one
0,[02:02] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: and the rest of it?
0,[02:02] <Glycan> No, I'm not, I think- this is a windows vista machine that got U put on it- nothing more.
0,[02:02] <escott> FoolsRun, by switching the boot order you may be switching the numbering.. so grub is looking for hd1 which doesn't exist because hd1 is not hd0
0,[02:02] <AaeRohn> Azelphur: 1.3.19
0,[02:02] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: yea, now your on the latest, I always like to confirm that one :p
0,[02:02] <comthre3> anyone?
0,[02:02] <escott> FoolsRun, remember SATA is closer to SCSI than it is to IDE
0,[02:02] <Glycan> Ergo, no GNU stuff.
0,[02:02] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: next up have you checked the wine appdb?
0,[02:02] <rmatte> After upgrading to 11.04 I'm getting flashing white squares when I view flash video (for basically any site except youtube).  Does anyone have a fix for this?
0,[02:03] <FoolsRun> escott: so it's truly impossible to fix this from inside my working hard drive, because as soon as I remove that drive, everything renumbers and it breaks.
0,[02:03] <gueriLLaPunK> omg im so scared. i just installed 11.04 and ive never used a ubuntu OS before.
0,[02:03] <gueriLLaPunK> change is scary
0,[02:03] <AaeRohn> Azelphur: you be talking to a guy who don't know computers as much as he would like
0,[02:03] <bison> what should i use in my nvidia card? proprietary or open source?
0,[02:03] <rmatte> gueriLLaPunK: you'll survive
0,[02:03] <comthre3> Hi, can someone help me with an issue im facing with uShare? Im using 11.04 downloaded ushare from the repo, setup everything is fine and dandy. dlna option is turned on, my PS3 recognizes the uPnP i can also see the folders, but for some reason the server wont load the files. all the folders/subfolders are there, but the ps3 and my other upnp device shows no data. how can i solve this?
0,[02:03] <escott> FoolsRun, there may be some magic to do that, but these are easy to fix from a livecd and a chroot environment
0,[02:04] <ZykoticK9> bison, only YOU can answer that question
0,[02:04] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=19141 have a read and see if there's anything relevant to you
0,[02:04] <Glycan> Can I put GRUB on a cd?
0,[02:04] <comthre3> sorry for flooding, but i dont know the protocol for asking questions here,,
0,[02:04] <gueriLLaPunK> for a SSH tunnel app. im using gSTM. is there a better one?
0,[02:04] <escott> FoolsRun, I would break it permanenty and then fix it from a chroot
0,[02:04] <tensorpudding> bison: i recommend using the proprietary driver
0,[02:04] <rmatte> comthre3: Use mediatomb instead
0,[02:04] <bison> after update, my system is not working anymore, black screen
0,[02:04] <tensorpudding> Glycan: how would that work?
0,[02:04] <gueriLLaPunK> i was normally using putty on windows
0,[02:04] <FoolsRun> escott: if only I could get any removable media to boot on this machine.
0,[02:04] <tensorpudding> Glycan: you never said if GRUB came up when you held down right shift
0,[02:05] <comthre3> rmatte, mediatomb wont autostart, neither will it autorefresh the content, plus ushare is lighter,,
0,[02:05] <bison> tensorpudding: i use proprietary driver in 11.04 but it hangs
0,[02:05] <rmatte> comthre3: I personally use ps3 media center
0,[02:05] <comthre3> rmatte JAVA?
0,[02:05] <Glycan> Is there any reason at all for a computly Win machine to have GRUB on it? ANd, no.
0,[02:05] <escott> FoolsRun, if you have this kind of physical access could you temporarily attach a sata cdrom device?
0,[02:05] <rmatte> ps3mediaserver rather
0,[02:05] <rmatte> and yes, it is java based
0,[02:05] <gueriLLaPunK> Is there a guide somewhere that recommends what software I should install for 11.04?
0,[02:05] <FoolsRun> escott: if I had one, sure :)
0,[02:06] <tensorpudding> Glycan: did you remove Ubuntu? if so, you should remove GRUB. otherwise, keep GRUB on
0,[02:06] <rmatte> it's works amazingly well
0,[02:06] <comthre3> rmatte too heavy,, tried it but couldnt figure it out too much transcoding and such,
0,[02:06] <Glycan> I did not remove U, I removed Win, there is no grub.
0,[02:06] <tensorpudding> gueriLLaPunK: you can search by category in the Software Center, and there are recommendations and reviews
0,[02:06] <FoolsRun> escott: presuming I can get a Natty livecd booted, what are the steps? install-grub has hanged on me every time I've tried it so far.
0,[02:06] <Glycan> Can I make a livecd out of grub?
0,[02:06] <rmatte> comthre3: also, why do you think mediatomb won't autostart?
0,[02:06] <tensorpudding> gueriLLaPunK: it depends on what you want
0,[02:06] <rmatte> comthre3: it did last time I used it
0,[02:07] <escott> FoolsRun, you could also try the #grub channel and see if they know any tricks, I'm just guessing that is the source of the problems, they could probably confirm
0,[02:07] <comthre3> rmatte,  it wont for some reason now, in my case its running as root,
0,[02:07] <FoolsRun> escott: I'm pretty sure you're right. I just don't know how to fix it :)
0,[02:07] <comthre3> rmatte, cant figure out how to change that
0,[02:07] <tensorpudding> Glycan: you're not making any sense
0,[02:07] <Glycan> ?
0,[02:07] <Glycan> Nither are you.
0,[02:07] <escott> FoolsRun, mount the ubuntu system, bind mount /dev and /proc, chroot in as root, run grub-install and grub-mkconfig
0,[02:07] <rmatte> comthre3: The last time I used it it automagically installed a /etc/init.d file for it and would auto-run it on startup
0,[02:08] <rmatte> comthre3: then you'd actually manage the settings via a web browser
0,[02:08] <rmatte> I assume it's still relatively the same
0,[02:08] <FoolsRun> escott: I'll try, but grub-install hung after finding /boot/grub when I tried it before.
0,[02:08] <rmatte> also, it supports auto-refreshing of content
0,[02:08] <tensorpudding> Glycan: You said that your machine was "complete win", then you said that you removed Windows
0,[02:08] <gueriLLaPunK> where can I find a site that shows a screenshot of different GNOME themes?
0,[02:08] <Glycan> There is no grub, there are leftovers from Windows, there is Ubuntu but whatever the boot loader is, it points to Windows leftovers (possibly windows kernel, I have no idea what hapend to that)
0,[02:08] <escott> FoolsRun, i've never had that problem, so I'm not sure what is going on there
0,[02:09] <Glycan> It used to be win, and then I dleted eavyrthign in the Windows folder due to space/mispartitioning issues
0,[02:09] <tensorpudding> Glycan: then it sounds like GRUB is on there, since when you install Ubuntu you put GRUB on
0,[02:09] <comthre3> rmatte, i honestly couldnt find anything online that was even remotely close to automagically, all howto's consisted of editing various files to get it to autostart, tried all, and nothing
0,[02:09] <Glycan> Really?
0,[02:09] <Glycan> Oh, I get it know.
0,[02:09] <tensorpudding> Glycan: GRUB is the bootloader for Ubuntu, you see.
0,[02:09] <Glycan> I see.
0,[02:09] <tensorpudding> Glycan: removing Windows shouldn't make it not work though
0,[02:10] <Glycan> Whatever bootloader is first, is window's.
0,[02:10] <tensorpudding> Glycan: do you get a menu when you boot asking you which you want to boot into?
0,[02:10] <comthre3> rmatte, i keep on getting data is corrupted in PMS do you know how to solve that?
0,[02:10] <Glycan> No.
0,[02:10] <tensorpudding> Glycan: did you get that before you removed windows?
0,[02:10] <Glycan> No.
0,[02:10] <rmatte> comthre3: where are you seeing that error, on the ps3 itself?
0,[02:10] <tensorpudding> Glycan: then how did you boot into ubuntu?
0,[02:10] <Glycan> I had eavrything workign before I removed windows.
0,[02:10] <yuskhanzab> how to share folder between windows and ubuntu?
0,[02:10] <comthre3> rmatte,  yes
0,[02:11] <tensorpudding> yuskhanzab: on the same machine?
0,[02:11] <yuskhanzab> i mean betweean another computer
0,[02:11] <syrinx_> !samba | yuskhanzab
0,[02:11] <ZykoticK9> yuskhanzab, check out Samba
0,[02:11] <ubottu> yuskhanzab: Samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT.
0,[02:11] <tensorpudding> yuskhanzab: windows file sharing is available on ubuntu, it's called samba
0,[02:11] <escott> FoolsRun, you could also dd over the grub, then switch the device order, then reinstall grub on what would then be sda
0,[02:11] <tensorpudding> yuskhanzab: it integrates seamlessly with ubuntu's shared folders
0,[02:12] <escott> FoolsRun, your bios should see that sda has all zeros in the mbr and move on to sdb to boot
0,[02:12] <Glycan> Firmware boots window's bootloader. which sees 'ubuntu' (e.g. grub), wich you can choose, and then choose ubuntu.
0,[02:12] <Glycan> E.g. two-step thing.
0,[02:12] <yuskhanzab> need to install it 1st?
0,[02:12] <tensorpudding> Glycan: that's odd
0,[02:12] <rmatte> comthre3: I just installed mediatomb and it does come with a startup script: /etc/init.d/mediatomb.  As far as PMS goes, you need to check the traces tab and correct anything you see there (you may have to install codecs via aptitude)
0,[02:12] <tensorpudding> Glycan: you did install grub when you installed ubuntu right?
0,[02:12] <Glycan> Presuamably.
0,[02:12] <tensorpudding> Glycan: are they on separate disks?
0,[02:12] <Glycan> No.
0,[02:13] <tensorpudding> Glycan: okay, well, you'll need to reinstall grub anyway
1,[02:13] <katya^> hello, I was wondering if it's possible to change the screen-edge that the unity launcher is on
0,[02:13] <Glycan> There was a non-wondow bootloader, so I guess that was grub
0,[02:13] <comthre3> rmatte, please hook me up with that autostart script, are u on natty? i cannot for the life of me get it to autostart
1,[02:13] <katya^> its kind of cool but its hard to get used to it being on the left
0,[02:13] <Glycan> How do I install grub without acces?
0,[02:13] <Glycan> CD?
1,[02:13] <Griemak> @katya^ No, not yet.
1,[02:13] <katya^> what about with a source patch?
0,[02:13] <rmatte> comthre3: yes I'm on natty, check if the script is there for you
0,[02:13] <MrKeuner> hello, natty here... in synaptic, items in residual config section cannot be purged... Any idea what may be wrong? is it me or everyone?
0,[02:13] <tacomaster> i just want to say that 11.04 is stunning
0,[02:13] <tensorpudding> Glycan: what do you mean without CD?
0,[02:13] <yakubori> hello
0,[02:14] <tensorpudding> Glycan: you can't boot from a live cd?
0,[02:14] <syrinx_> hi yakubori
0,[02:14] <Glycan> Not really.
0,[02:14] <syrinx_> tacomaster: agreed
0,[02:14] <randomperson> question: is installing ubuntu supposed to cause the computer to go black right after it says "resizing partition"?
0,[02:14] <Glycan> All it makes is a bad shell.
0,[02:14] <Glycan> No GUI.
0,[02:14] <Jordan_U> randomperson: No.
0,[02:14] <Glycan> Some 'busybox' BS.
0,[02:14] <tensorpudding> Glycan: odd
0,[02:14] <tensorpudding> Glycan: this is the same thing you installed from?
0,[02:15] <Jordan_U> randomperson: Do *not* pull the plug.
0,[02:15] <syrinx_> ^^
0,[02:15] <randomperson> Jordan_U: it wasn't unplugged
0,[02:15] <syrinx_> randomperson: wait for a bit
0,[02:15] <AaeRohn> Azelphur: found the ubuntu directions, and as I said before, I don't know Ubuntu as much as I want to.... I'm a tad lost
0,[02:15] <geekbri> anybody know a good way to test how much load a bind server can handle ?
0,[02:15] <Azelphur> AaeRohn: time for a pm I suppose :)
0,[02:15] <randomperson> it was folded shut for a bit, though...
0,[02:16] <Jordan_U> randomperson: Some people freak out and force shutdown the computer. I was just making sure you didn't do that :)
0,[02:16] <Glycan> Crap, I'm really sorry, I have to go.
0,[02:16] <Glycan> Are you here tommorow around four?
0,[02:16] <Jordan_U> randomperson: Do you still hear the drive spinning?
0,[02:17] <randomperson> Jordan_U: no
0,[02:17] <Griemak> geekbri: Dnsperf and Inflobox offer good tools
0,[02:17] <Glycan> Anyways, I have to go, hope to see you tommorow.
0,[02:17] <comthre3> rmatte,  hmmm its there,, lemme check something
0,[02:17] <geekbri> griemak: thank you!
0,[02:17] <Jordan_U> randomperson: Can you try pinging the computer?
0,[02:17] <randomperson> "pinging"?
0,[02:18] <chille> http://chille.se/temp/GPT.png ^_^
0,[02:18] <escott> randomperson, ping ip.address.of.computer
0,[02:18] <comthre3> mediatomb/mediatomb.db): Permission denied
0,[02:18] <comthre3>  
0,[02:18] <Jordan_U> randomperson: Are you familiar with the network troubleshooting tool "ping"?
0,[02:18] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: According to that utility, there are sectors that are 'waiting to be remapped'. What does that mean and how do I... remap them?
0,[02:18] <randomperson> no...
0,[02:18] <escott> randomperson, from the command line
0,[02:18] <comthre3> rmatte, I still need to be root to run it, so autostarting can be a problem..
0,[02:18] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, I have NO idea - never heard of that before.  Good luck!
0,[02:18] <randomperson> hm? the computer screen is blank
0,[02:18] <escott> chille, what was your gpt question?
0,[02:18] <geekbri> griemak: no chance youve tried to run a dns server on an ec2 micro instance is there ?
0,[02:19] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: :/
0,[02:19] <CannedCorn> hey guys, is there anything i should be aware of if upgrading to 11.04 from 10.10
0,[02:19] <CannedCorn> do you just do apt-get dist-upgrade?
0,[02:19] <jrib> !notes | CannedCorn
0,[02:19] <ubottu> CannedCorn: Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) release notes can be found here: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1104

0,[02:19] <RyanD> Hey folks, trying to get Ubuntu running but I'm having trouble *connecting* to my router with a D-Link USB Card (DWA-125 07d1:3c16).. I'm able to see a list of available connections but it's never able to connect..  Could someone point me in the right direction?  I've searched the forums but haven't found much related to my specific issue..

0,[02:19] <Griemak> geekbri: sorry, no I haven't
0,[02:19] <chille> escott: i have trouble with booting my system. the kernel starts but can't find the root filesystem
0,[02:19] <rmatte> comthre3: you're not understanding... mediatomb runs as a server in the background
0,[02:19] <geekbri> griemak well thanks for the info!
0,[02:20] <chille> escott: however GParted find it and i can mount it without any trouble
0,[02:20] <escott> chille, it may be that the initrd doesn't understand gpt
0,[02:20] <Philip`_> how can i delete a file that i can't in the browser?
0,[02:20] <rmatte> comthre3: those autostart scripts in /etc/init.d are executed as root on bootup
0,[02:20] <rmatte> comthre3: so once it's started on bootup, then you manage it from your web browser
0,[02:20] <rmatte> comthre3: and it's always running as long as the computer is running
0,[02:20] <Jordan_U> randomperson: Does the monitor appear off (no backlight) or just black?
0,[02:20] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, this appears to have some info for ya http://kb.acronis.com/content/9133
0,[02:20] <chille> escott: the kernel can't even mount the root file system and start initrd
0,[02:21] <aeon-ltd> Philip`_: where is this file?
0,[02:21] <chille> escott: i just get a kernel panic
0,[02:21] <escott> chille, i don't know a better way to find out for sure than to unpack the initrd, but thats probably why
0,[02:21] <Philip`_> aeon-ltd: D:\, I get this error: Unable to trash file: Input/output error
0,[02:21] <randomperson> Jordan_U: I can't really tell... but some of the little lights on it are on
0,[02:21] <Philip`_> it's a 0byte size file
0,[02:21] <comthre3> rmatte, I know thats whats supposed to happen theoretically, in my case its different unfortunately. it wont start on startup, and I cannot configure it from the webrowser unless i run it from the terminal
0,[02:21] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: Hm, thanks. I googled and found out that this program has a 'self-test feature' which, in theory, may fix it. Running that now
0,[02:21] <chille> escott: oh.. wait.. initrd.. of course.. i'm mixing it up with something else
0,[02:21] <chille> escott: well, i can try unpacking initrd and see whats inside
0,[02:22] <multipass|2> is there any way to revert compiz fusion back in 11.04? back to 10.10?
0,[02:22] <rmatte> comthre3: how do you know it won't run on startup?  Have you even tried now that the script is there?
0,[02:22] <randomperson> whoa, now it just turned back on...
0,[02:22] <randomperson> it says "resizing partition" again. well, that was strange.
0,[02:22] <comthre3> rmatte, give me a sec, i just changed the user from root to my user, ill give it a restart and check,, ill brb
0,[02:22] <escott> chille, what kind of system is this? bios + gpt disk, or pure efi?
0,[02:22] <Damis> Hi, I'm on a live CD. I am trying to use Gparted to turn a number of partitions into unallocated space, is there a way to do this?
0,[02:22] <chille> escott: BIOS + GPT
0,[02:23] <aeon-ltd> Philip`_: no idea, but i assume you can force it with sudo
0,[02:23] <Philip`_> I don't know how aeon-ltd
0,[02:23] <rmatte> Damis: yeh, just select the partitions in gparted and remove them, then click apply, it's not hard
0,[02:24] <Damis> rmatte: Select them and press delete?
0,[02:24] <CannedCorn> thanks guys
0,[02:24] <Dylan-sama> hey guys, which manpage should i be reading to follow all the bond* keywords in /etc/network/interfaces ?
0,[02:24] <Dylan-sama> they don't seem to be in man interfaces
0,[02:24] <escott> chille, you could try using gdisk to establish a hybrid mbr, its a bit of a pain to maintain (you have to always use gdisk to manage it)
0,[02:24] <randomperson> is being disconnected from the internet in the middle of installing likely to cause problems?
0,[02:24] <aeon-ltd> Philip`_: who created this file?
0,[02:25] <eiriksvin> hey, has anyone heard of how to install Natty onto a ACPI x64 based PC?
0,[02:25] <jimmybrite> why does windows7 repair sees the windows partition as D:, is it because of the dreaded "system reserved 100mb" partition?
0,[02:25] <escott> chille, that way you could create a small /boot at the front of the disk, and give it a traditional msdos filesystem
0,[02:25] <DrFrankenstein> Hi, after doing a clean install of Natty, most GTK applications are *not* using the theme I selected in gnome-appearence-properties. Instead, they use a default control style, kind of like "Redmond".
0,[02:25] <chille> escott: yeah. or i could just reinstall ubuntu and everything would probably work :(
0,[02:25] <rmatte> Damis: you're basically just asking how to remove partitions using gparted, right?
0,[02:25] <escott> rather partition
0,[02:25] <Philip`_> aeon-ltd: I did, it was a file that I needed on windows, but it is in use by Windows right now, but I can't disable it in windows without problem, so I want to remove this file and replace it with another with the same name, but I'm getting errors.
0,[02:25] <chille> escott: it worked the 2-3 first times i booted the computer
0,[02:26] <Damis> rmatte: Correct, I need to change the existing partitions into one unallocated block.
0,[02:26] <escott> ok
0,[02:26] <Damis> Whilst keeping my HFS+partition intact
0,[02:26] <aplund> Does anyone have 11.04 and noveau working with suspend/resume ?
0,[02:26] <aeon-ltd> Philip`_: you should really ask in #windows they'll know more
0,[02:27] <Philip`_> aeon-ltd: It's not a problem with windows, it's Ubuntu that I am in now that I'm trying to delete.
0,[02:27] <rmatte> Damis: Let's say you have Part1|Part2|Part3 and you remove Part1 and Part3, there is no way to move Part2 to where Part1 was allowing Parts2 and Part3 to become one unallocated block.
0,[02:27] <jimmybrite> i think im gonna forget about 11.04, I've been spending almost 2 weeks trying to get it to work...
0,[02:28] <Ziber> would anyone who's familiar with smartmontools in ubuntu 10.10 be able to tell me what 'check filesystem' does exactly?
0,[02:28] <rmatte> Damis: the only way I can think of doing it would be to backup the whole filesystem structure, delete all partitions, create a new one, and copy the files back
0,[02:28] <eiriksvin> hey, has anyone heard of how to install Natty onto a ACPI x64 based PC?
0,[02:28] <groundnuty> hey, anyone recall a video player with ability to bookmark parts/time frames of video?
0,[02:29] <Damis> rmatte: I see. Well the result of removing them will still serve my need. Thanks for the help :)
0,[02:29] <rmatte> Damis: no problem
0,[02:29] <aeon-ltd> Philip`_: ok then, cd into the directory and 'sudo rm nameoffile'
0,[02:29]  * Dylan-sama prods again about network bond* commands
0,[02:30] <Philip`_> aeon-ltd: how can I get into the file system? It's on D:\

0,[02:31] <Ziber> would anyone who's familiar with smartmontools in ubuntu 10.10 be able to tell me what 'check filesystem' does exactly?
0,[02:31] <Dylan-sama> didn't mean to paste that...
0,[02:31] <aeon-ltd> Philip`_: it'll be in /mnt as whatever you mounted it as
0,[02:32] <eiriksvin> hey, has anyone heard of how to install Natty onto a ACPI x64 based PC?
0,[02:32] <ZykoticK9> aeon-ltd, don't you mean /media?
0,[02:32] <aeon-ltd> Philip`_: what ZykoticK9 said
0,[02:33] <Philip`_> aeon-ltd: this is one of the few times on Ubuntu, I mounted it in the nautilus, I have no idea how to navigate in the terminal
0,[02:33] <kristianpaul> Can i dd a ubuntu iso to a memory stick to load ubuntu from usb?
0,[02:33] <yakubori> nice rhythmbox bug - click the 'Start or Stop Visulization' icon while a song is playing, then click the X to close the visualization window and that song will get deleted! rather than simply closing the visualization, the player will move on to the next track, if applicable :D

0,[02:33] <ZykoticK9> Philip`_, in a terminal if you type "mount" it will show you everything that is mounted, then "cd /mount/point/shown" to change to it's location
0,[02:34] <Dogears> What is the correct syntax to upgrade virtualbox to the latest version
0,[02:34] <yakubori> that's 11.04 Desktop btw
0,[02:34] <rlcarr> I am upgrading from 10.04.2 to 10.10.  Upgrade went fine until libdevmapper upgrade.  Has been sitting there with CPU pegged at 70% for 30 minutes.  Any way to restart the upgrade/try again?
0,[02:34] <ZykoticK9> Dogears, if you installed using an Ubuntu method "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" should update everything possible.
0,[02:34] <kristianpaul> thanks
0,[02:34] <kristianpaul> bye bye
0,[02:34] <Philip`_> ZykoticK9: Thank's got it, how do I delete the file ?
0,[02:35] <yakubori> thanfully, the music is not deleted from the filesystem, just the rhythmbox interface...
0,[02:35] <ZykoticK9> Philip`_, "rm filename"
0,[02:35] <hiexpo> rlcarr, just stay with 10.04 it is lts

0,[02:35] <ubottu> To install a Java runtime on Ubuntu on 10.04 LTS and newer, see http://tinyurl.com/2ffg7cc -  For the Sun Java products and browser plugin, search for the sun-java6- packages in the !partner repository on Lucid (which must be enabled), or !multiverse repository on older releases.
0,[02:35] <Philip`_> ok sweet, thanks
0,[02:36] <rlcarr> hiexpo: it's a desktop and I'm trying to get it up to 11.04.  Anyway, I've already started the upgrade.  It's partway through and has already installed a lot of things.
0,[02:36] <eiriksvin> hey, has anyone heard of how to install Natty onto a ACPI x64 based PC?
0,[02:37] <ZykoticK9> eiriksvin, what do you mean by "ACPI x64 based PC"?  You can use AMD64 to install to either Intel/AMD 64 CPUs.
0,[02:37] <hiexpo> rlcarr, ok unfortunately you will be sorry    10.04 is the best one right now

0,[02:40] <ZykoticK9> Dogears, add Oracle's repo then!
0,[02:40] <Dogears> ZykoticK9: great thanks
1,[02:41] <Jordan_U> SeanChambers: Right click, open new window.
0,[02:41] <GThoth> can some one tell me what happened to the md5sum verification numbers that we use to verify the installation cd after the download?
0,[02:41] <pamela> hi im having an issue with wireless. in 10.10 i had to activate an additional driver for my wireless to work. in 11.04, it says the driver is still activated, but it isnt showing any wireless card as being installed
0,[02:41] <Jordan_U> GThoth: Nothing has happened to them.
0,[02:41] <pamela> or at least its acting as though no network card is installed
1,[02:41] <SeanChambers> Jordan_U: I don't have that option when I right click on the icon
0,[02:41] <ZykoticK9> Dogears, see http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads for instructions

1,[02:42] <Jordan_U> SeanChambers: It may be application specific. I know it's offered for nautilus.
0,[02:43] <SeanChambers> ahh
1,[02:43] <SeanChambers> yeah, firefox has the option
1,[02:43] <SeanChambers> chrome doesnt :(
1,[02:44] <Jordan_U> SeanChambers: Check if a bug report has been filed already and if not try filing one.
0,[02:44] <litropy_> does anyone have an update as to why update apt-xapian-index has to run and take up 100% cpu?
1,[02:44] <SeanChambers> Jordan_U: ok. thanks
0,[02:44] <eiriksvin> <ZykoticK9> i used amd64, but i cant get gpart to run or anything
0,[02:45] <ZykoticK9> eiriksvin, do you get an error message?
0,[02:49] <francesc1> so has anyone made the switch to 11.04
0,[02:49] <jimmybrite> tried to, but I can't
0,[02:49] <UbuntuNoob> i tried it i didnt care for it i wiped and came back
0,[02:49] <jiohdi> francesc1: so far so good
0,[02:49] <francesc1> UbuntuNoob: LOL yup did the exact same thing today
0,[02:50] <jw_> Hi, are there any sound themes for Ubuntu 11.04? If so where/how can I get them?
0,[02:50] <Dr_Willis> No real issues with 11.04 here.
1,[02:50] <jiohdi> francesc1: but I am not using unity
0,[02:50] <syrinx_> UbuntuNoob: you might want to change your nick....
0,[02:50] <ZykoticK9> UbuntuNoob, francesc1 I'd LOVE to know how many people have done just that.
1,[02:50] <UbuntuNoob> yeah, i felt like i was using some sort of mac os with that sidebar
0,[02:50] <UbuntuNoob> why syrinx_
0,[02:50] <Dr_Willis> jw_:  i dont recall seeing many (if any) sound themes at all. Gnome-look web site might have some.
1,[02:50] <francesc1> Unity is useless i find
0,[02:50] <syrinx_> !noob | UbuntuNoob
0,[02:50] <ubottu> UbuntuNoob: Acronyms or statements like noob, jfgi, stfu, or rtfm are not welcome in this channel. Period.
0,[02:50] <jimmybrite> I'd be happy if I could get my hd3000/opengl/java working with 10.10
0,[02:50] <jw_> dr_willis, thank you!
0,[02:51] <UbuntuNoob> honestly ive had this name for literally like a year
1,[02:51] <Dr_Willis> I dont find unity and mac the same at all.. but i have also started using Cairo Dock + unity. :) so i guess its even more mac-like now.
0,[02:51] <syrinx_> :/
0,[02:51] <francesc1> Dr_Willis: Have u tried gnome 3 ... thats more mac like i find
0,[02:52] <barcef> what is the new replacement for the power inhibit applet? If you watch movies you need it.
1,[02:52] <UbuntuNoob> not necessarily the same as a mac os, but the sidebar was all to reminiscent, and im really happy with the taskbar at the top of 10.04/10 with applications, places, system, et
0,[02:52] <jw_> I finally just got all the effects to work on mine along with docky. Now that I have my environment close to setup I can start enjoying Natty a little more now.
0,[02:53] <guampa> need a hand with this...what could be setting my hostname to "localhost.localdomain" on each boot? /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts show the original name of the computer
0,[02:53] <UbuntuNoob> does k3b really not burn an audio cd if theyre in an mp3 format and not wav?
0,[02:54] <guampa> if i run "hostname myrealhostname.net" everything gets back to normal
0,[02:54] <barcef> guampa, maybe you aren';t actually saving them. are you changing them with sudo before the editor?
0,[02:54] <PlayStationJunki> sup everyone
0,[02:55] <guampa> i'm looking at their contents now, they show the correct name
0,[02:56] <guampa> even more, some gettys DO show the correct hostname, which leads me to think the hostname is correct at some part of the boot process
0,[02:56] <guampa> (when i login i get again localhost.localdomain at the prompt)
0,[02:56] <barcef> guampa,  then I don't have a clue. Just remembere someone who was doing ti so fast that they didn't notice that the changes were not taking effect.
0,[02:56] <Dr_Willis> guampa:  check the host name command. make sure itts not just your bash prompt thats incorrect.
0,[02:56] <GeneralAntilles> Resume is failing on two machines with 11.04. Same symptoms on both. Debugging's Magic number doesn't hash any hardware. Any hints?
0,[02:56] <Dr_Willis> guampa:  check value of your PS1 variable.
0,[02:57] <Ziber> is there anything i can try from within ubuntu to correct bad disk sectors?
0,[02:57] <guampa> Dr_Willis: if i  type hostname -f i get "localhost.localdomain"
1,[02:57] <DrFrankenstein> Hi, after doing a clean install of Natty, most GTK applications are *not* using the theme I selected in gnome-appearence-properties. Instead, they use a default control style, probably "Raleigh". This happens no matter which theme I choose, including "Ambience", and no matter which desktop I'm using (Unity, Gnome...).
0,[02:57] <barcef> GeneralAntilles,  not working on my HP z6 either... it seems to be very widespread.
0,[02:58] <barcef> what is the new replacement for the power inhibit applet? If you watch movies you need it.
0,[02:58] <GeneralAntilles> barcef, so, downgrade to 10.10 for the time being if I want usable portables?
0,[02:58]  * GeneralAntilles wonders how this passed QA
0,[02:58] <GeneralAntilles> Also: is there a thread or a bug somewhere I can follow?
0,[02:59] <IWantFroyo> @GeneralAntilles What other OSes do you have on there? (assuming you're using partitioned magic)
0,[02:59] <ZykoticK9> GeneralAntilles, there is basically no QA in Ubuntu - just a very frequent release schedule that must be maintained.
0,[03:00] <devkorcvince> does 11.04 use compiz? or something else?
0,[03:00] <GeneralAntilles> IWantFroyo: one is Ubuntu-only. The other is currently Ubuntu and Windows 7 (mostly because 11.04 refuses to work properly).
0,[03:00] <IWantFroyo> @devkorcvince yes it uses compiz
0,[03:00] <ZykoticK9> devkorcvince, compiz (or a modified version of it)
0,[03:00] <GeneralAntilles> ZykoticK9: well, that explains a lot. . . .
0,[03:00] <IWantFroyo> @GeneralAntilles DOS partitioned systems like Windows tend to screw stuff up
0,[03:00] <IWantFroyo> @GeneralAntilles try rebooting normally from Windows several times
0,[03:01] <GeneralAntilles> IWantFroyo: yes, well, why is the Ubuntu-only machine doing the same shit?
0,[03:01] <GeneralAntilles> I call strawman. :)
0,[03:01] <Ziber> Would 'a few bad sectors' (2047 to be exact) stop my home folder from opening on ubuntu 10.10?
0,[03:01] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, if your home directory is located on those bad sectors - very possibly
0,[03:01] <barcef> GeneralAntilles,  read the hibrenate issues with 10.04/10 to point you in the right direction. It might be safe to assume that if those units presented a hibernation issue with a previous version, then the same fix might work in natty.
0,[03:02] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, can you get to the directory from terminal?
0,[03:02] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: yeah, I can
0,[03:02] <GeneralAntilles> barcef: 10.10 worked fine on the netbook, haven't tried 10.10 on the x220.
0,[03:02] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, it's just nautilus that the issue?
0,[03:02] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: I succesfully rsync'd my files to my external HD
0,[03:02] <Ziber> perhaps?
0,[03:03] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: is reinstalling nautilus a viable solution?
0,[03:03] <barcef> GeneralAntilles,  ahhh.. I had the same issue with my netbook until I switched to the UNR version, I recommend it as it's more resource friendly with netbooks.
0,[03:03] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, have you run an fsck on the partition?
0,[03:03] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: Can you run it on the same partition that ubuntu is running on?
0,[03:03] <IWantFroyo> @Ziber Is Nautilus the only file manager you've tried? @GeneralAntilles Sorry I don't have anything
0,[03:03] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, i doubt reinstall nautilus would do anything.
0,[03:04] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, no the partition shouldn't be mounted - thus a LiveCD would be ideal
0,[03:04] <GeneralAntilles> IWantFroyo: fair enough. :)
0,[03:04] <Ziber> IWantFroyo: It was working perfectly fine up until this afternoon.
0,[03:05] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: This was installed on a loaned flash drive. I dont actually have a CD of ubuntu 10.10. Was thinking of doing that tomorrow, in fact. On the off chance that I do have to reinstasll.
0,[03:05] <IWantFroyo> Ziber: Did you update or see any weird action going on before the break?
0,[03:05] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, is the flash drive a LiveUSB?

0,[03:05] <Ziber> IWantFroyo: My windows VM was acting a little slow, but other than that, no.

0,[03:06] <ZykoticK9> pux0r3, time to change your password
0,[03:06] <pux0r3> yes, yes it is
0,[03:06] <devkorcvince> hmmm I would probably wait for 11.10 or 12.04 LTS base on the feeds here
0,[03:06] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: It was loaned when I originally installed. I had to put all the original data back on it.
0,[03:06] <pux0r3> any help for a n00b?
0,[03:06] <IWantFroyo> Ziber: Do you mean a VM in ubuntu running Windows, or vice versa?
0,[03:06] <escott> !help | pux0r3
0,[03:06] <ubottu> pux0r3: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
0,[03:06] <Ziber> IWantFroyo: yes, a virtualbox VM inside ubuntu, running windows 7.
0,[03:07] <pux0r3> nevermind
0,[03:07] <Ziber> IWantFroyo: In fact, thanks for reminding me. I should back that up, too.
0,[03:07] <ZykoticK9> Ziber, I'd recommend you find some LiveMedia and fsck the drive.  But the dmesg I/O errors still suggest something physically wrong with the drive (in my opinion/experience, so your backups might be important)
0,[03:07] <Ziber> ZykoticK9: Yeah... that didnt seem like a good sign to me.
1,[03:07] <shmup> so with an extended display on 11.04 using ubuntu, can i NOT have the unity panel on the other monitor?
1,[03:08] <shmup> with the hopes of using a gnome-panel, but i just wanna disable the 2nd panel to begin with. its redundant because it lists all the same shit on it that i cant right click and remove.
0,[03:08] <lahwran> how would I use gvfs/nautilus network stuff to connect to an ftp server?
1,[03:08] <IWantFroyo> shmup: Alt-F1, type 'gconf-editor', look for the gnome options, panels, and then uncheck the panel you don't want
0,[03:09] <ZykoticK9> lahwran, "Connect to Server" and FTP is in the dropdown list

0,[03:14] <IWantFroyo> connor___: go to software sources
0,[03:14] <iggyology> I just started using xubuntu. I tried putting a firefox icon in the launch bar. Now it only opens through a terminal window. Can someone help me make it work without a terminal window?
0,[03:14] <Chaorain> can someone help me fix this problem? my bug is exactly described here.http://rudd-o.com/new-projects/portablelinux/issues/59
0,[03:14] <connor__> how do i speed up ubuntu
0,[03:14] <cdavis> escott: I will check
0,[03:14] <IWantFroyo> connor___: edit-software sources, then check the mirror
0,[03:14] <IWantFroyo> connor____: It is possible your mirror is down.
0,[03:14] <Chaorain> connor__: are you using 11.04?
0,[03:15] <bison> is it advisable to download the latest nvidia driver for 11.04 on their website?
0,[03:15] <brianl> How would I go about upgrading my Ubuntu from 32bit to 64bit? Or do i need to do a clean install?
0,[03:15] <cdavis> escott: I don't have any export LC_ in .bashrc
0,[03:15] <ZykoticK9> brianl, clean install is ONLY way
0,[03:15] <IWantFroyo> brianl: You will have to do a clean install.
0,[03:15] <brianl> yeah i figured, okay thanks
0,[03:15] <escott> cdavis, what does `locale` say
0,[03:15] <iggyology> I did the same thing with Thunderbird. It won't load either.
0,[03:15] <connor__> well when i closed my lid for a while and opened it ubuntu 11.04 was installed is that normal
0,[03:16] <connor__> im also using an acer aspire one
1,[03:16] <IWantFroyo> connor___: It's probably a glitch. Is it actually 11.04? (unity and all the good stuff?)
0,[03:16] <torrento> alguien sabe algo de esto? (xaralx:7417): Gdk-CRITICAL **: IA__gdk_window_get_visual: assertion `GDK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed
0,[03:16] <cdavis> escott: n_US.UTF-8 for most of them. LC_ALL has nothing
1,[03:16] <IWantFroyo> connor___: If it is, then it worked.
1,[03:16] <connor__> yes it has the fancy sidebar to the left and search
0,[03:17] <escott> cdavis, and LANG is en_US or en_GB
1,[03:17] <IWantFroyo> connor___: Then, unless it starts messing up, you have a successful upgrade.
0,[03:17] <iggyology> If a firefox icon in the launch bar only opens with a terminal window, is that because I have the wrong stuff in the command block?
0,[03:17] <connor__> bye its ok
0,[03:17] <cdavis> escott: LANG=en_US.UTF-8
0,[03:17] <ZykoticK9> iggyology, what' in the command block?  /usr/bin/firefox or similar?
0,[03:18] <escott> cdavis, what are Dell DRACs? it seems like your language is set to english in all the right places
0,[03:18] <k|oWn> Using the 11.04 Live CD, it gets to the point where the Ubuntu logo is on the screen with the five colored dots moving below it, but it never goes anywhere past there. Ive tried ctr-alt-f1 to look at a console for errors but that has nothing there. has anyone seen this hangup like this when trying to load into the Live CD ? or could it just be that my CD burned from the ISO using brasero with passing checksum, is currupted and I should tr
0,[03:18] <k|oWn> y making another one ?
0,[03:18] <iggyology> ZykoticK9, yes that's it

0,[03:19] <bison> after installing ubuntu 11.04, hangs
0,[03:19] <cdavis> escott: Dell Remote Access Cards, HTTP shows me spanish. When I first installed Google was in the wrong language too
0,[03:19] <IWantFroyo> k|oWn: Try holding down esc (going into grub), pressing e, and then typing acpi=off?
0,[03:19] <ZykoticK9> iggyology, that seem correct?  did you say you are using Xubuntu?  you might want to give the #xubuntu channel a try (if you don't get an answer here)
0,[03:20] <iggyology> it tried there, no luck, everyone is a bot I guess
0,[03:20] <cdavis> escott: Maybe it is just firefox, Chrome shows me in english
0,[03:20] <tarvid> how do I explore monitor detection?
0,[03:21] <escott> cdavis, there must be something in your firefox config which is sending a request for spanish... i didn't know http supported a preferred language header
0,[03:21] <iggyology> ZykoticK9, should I have anything in the working directory?
0,[03:21] <ZykoticK9> iggyology, no.  Is there a "run in terminal" checkbox or something?
0,[03:21] <Bangkalan> Anyone know where I can get ubuntu ultimate edition ?
0,[03:21] <cdavis> escott: OK, I will look in firefox
0,[03:22] <IWantFroyo> Bangkalan: There is no ubuntu ultimate, though canonical has training with ultimate in it
0,[03:22] <iggyology> ZykoticK9, I had to check the run in terminal block to make the icon work
0,[03:22] <ZykoticK9> Bangkalan, Ultimate Edition is not an official Ubuntu version, and not supported in this channel
0,[03:22] <iggyology> I wish I could get rid of that
0,[03:22] <ZykoticK9> iggyology, if "run in terminal" is checked, it's gonna open a terminal
0,[03:22] <IWantFroyo> Bangkalan: Ubuntu Ultimate is probably canonical.org's training service
0,[03:22] <IdleOne> IWantFroyo: no it isn't
0,[03:22] <Bangkalan> How i can get all package in ubuntu ? ?
0,[03:23] <ZykoticK9> IWantFroyo, Ultimate Edition is just some Ubuntu "ripoff" with added codecs etc.
0,[03:23] <IWantFroyo> Ubuntu Advantage. Whoops. In that case, there is no Ultimate.
0,[03:23] <k|oWn>  IWantFroyo: When should I hold down esc, after it starts loading the CD ?\
0,[03:23] <tarvid> Bangkalan, you won't like the result of installing 30,000 packages
0,[03:23] <iggyology> ZykoticK9, yes, but if it's not checked than the icon becomes a dud and does nothing when clicked
0,[03:23] <escott> Bangkalan, not to mention that you cannot install all packages on the same system as some conflict
0,[03:23] <IWantFroyo> k|oWn: Start holding it down at the purple screen. Just keep holding it.
0,[03:24] <ZykoticK9> iggyology, i have no idea man sorry, I don't use XFCE at all
0,[03:24] <IWantFroyo> k|oWn: You will get a list of possible boot options. 'e' at the first one.
0,[03:24] <__import__> does Ubuntu server's cron support running something at boot time?
0,[03:24] <Bangkalan> Anything I do in ubuntu it must get a package before . . .
0,[03:24] <k|oWn> IWantFroyo: purple screen? all i get is a black screen with the logo and five scrolling dots
0,[03:24] <escott> __import__, rc.locale
0,[03:24] <ZykoticK9> iggyology, actually I'm lying a little, i just got compiz running on XFCE the other day - but haven't tried it since.
0,[03:25] <__import__> additionally, will the cron run without the user logging in?
0,[03:25] <iggyology> thanks ZykoticK9, I'm learning still
0,[03:25] <IWantFroyo> k|oWn: Then at that screen. The beta screen was purple.
0,[03:25] <escott> __import__, cron does run without being logged in but boot time in /etc/rc.local
0,[03:25] <tarvid> __import__, yes
0,[03:25] <__import__> escott, ^ s/cron/script/
0,[03:26] <cntrational> Ubuntu does not detect my resolution. Help, please.
0,[03:26] <__import__> I'm sorry, I'm confused. My interpretation is a general yes. Cron can be set to run at boot up. Is this correct?
0,[03:26] <DocPlatypus> __import__: by default cron does run at boot
0,[03:26] <__import__> or rather, a cron line
0,[03:26] <ZykoticK9> cntrational, what Graphics card are you using "lspci | grep -i vga" from terminal if you are unsure.
0,[03:26] <brianl> If i am trying to ssh to my ubuntu box, are there some settings somewhere i need to change to enable that?
0,[03:27] <tarvid> cron does not run at bootup, it runs on a time schedule
0,[03:27] <escott> __import__, i'm not sure how cron handles boots, you should use a service in rc.local
0,[03:27] <IWantFroyo> cntrational: Go to monitors, and let it try to figure it out. If that doesn't work, try googling grub 2 ubuntu wiki, and selecting one of the VGA boot settings
0,[03:27] <__import__> escott, will rc.local 1) run the program as a specific user (ie, not root), and 2) be run without logging in?
0,[03:27] <DocPlatypus> __import__: some cron daemons will run a line with @reboot instead of a time once every boot
0,[03:28] <tarvid> escott, xrandr is you friend but you have to know a bit
0,[03:28] <__import__> DocPlatypus, does US 11.04 have this cron?
0,[03:28] <cntrational> ZykoticK9: "00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation N10 Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)"
0,[03:28] <escott> __import__, you can put something to run daily and if crond is not running at the required time i think it figures that out and runs it at the next opportunity, but for boot specific you want a service
0,[03:28] <ZykoticK9> cntrational, Intel has good linux support, what resolution are you looking for?  What is currently offered?
0,[03:29] <escott> __import__, rc.local will be run as root, but you could su down to the desired user, it would happen as a service (independent of gdm and user login)
0,[03:29] <escott> tarvid, i think you mean to tell cntrational about xrandr
0,[03:30] <bison> hey guys, need some help with my nvidia card
0,[03:30] <cntrational> ZykoticK9: I need a 1368x768 resolution, but the monitor preferences only have 1024x768
0,[03:30] <escott> cntrational, xrandr is not listing a 1368 mode?
0,[03:30] <bison> i installed 11.04 and what kind of video driver shoul i install,
0,[03:31] <UbuntuNoob> hi ubuntu wasnt mounting my iphone when i plugged it in and i started messing with stuff in the software center and now it doesnt even recognize that my iphone is plugged in what can i do to fix this
0,[03:31] <ZykoticK9> cntrational, is this on a laptop/netbook of some sort, or an external monitor?
0,[03:31] <econdudeawesome> `Howdy all! I had to delete my MoC config file to make it work with Ubuntu 10.10. Would anyone be willing to pastebin their ~/.moc/config example for me?
0,[03:31] <Propel> how do you guys like 11.04 release over 10.4?
0,[03:31] <PoPpiLLs> Ive been installing ubuntu with the same separate home partition for about 3-4 builds I'm I losing any functionality  by using the same home partition or should i do a fresh install and move over the home files i need
0,[03:31] <Takyoji[laptop]> How does one get S-Video working under 11.04 (if different than some prior versions)?
0,[03:31] <Propel> over 10.10*
1,[03:31] <cntrational> tarvid, escott: i already know about xrandr, yes, but i can't set it persistently, and using it breaks Unity
0,[03:32] <francesc1> Anyone in here famialar with the pulseaudio default.pa file ??
0,[03:32] <cntrational> ZykoticK9: it's a combined computer-monitor thing; the computer is built into the monitor
0,[03:32] <ZykoticK9> Propel, #ubuntu-offtopic question - this is support only (it's a very divisive question i think, you don't want my answer)
1,[03:32] <escott> cntrational, the breaking unity could be happening if your graphics card cant support gl at the higher resolution. is the N10 older or newer?
0,[03:32] <escott> cntrational, once you have a good mode you could put it into xorg.conf and force it
1,[03:32] <cntrational> escott: no, as in, resizing the resolution with xrandr causes unity to glitch
0,[03:32] <Propel> oh this is support chan
0,[03:32] <Osmodivs> Hello. What's the name of the program wich takes care of shutting down the system? I am tryin to file a bug report with ubuntu-bug <name of the program>
0,[03:33] <ZykoticK9> cntrational, so similar to a laptop screen I guess, sorry I don't have any suggestions for you - what others at saying xrandr might help.
0,[03:33] <ZykoticK9> s/at/are/
0,[03:33] <cntrational> escott: I've already tried editing xorg.conf, but it didn't work
0,[03:33] <escott> PoPpiLLs, not likely, there may be some features you are unaware of but thats all
0,[03:34] <tarvid> cntrational, try creating an xorg.conf from the running configuration first and then patching it
1,[03:34] <ZykoticK9> PoPpiLLs, with the change to Unity much of your home folder config files "may" cause issues.  Good luck.
0,[03:34] <cntrational> tarvid: how do I do that?
0,[03:35] <escott> PoPpiLLs, I find its helpful to version control select .* folders in ~ for those preferences I actually care about, and then migrat that
0,[03:35] <LinuxAway> hi
0,[03:36] <francesc1> Anyone in here famialar with the pulseaudio default.pa file ??
0,[03:36] <PoPpiLLs> good idea lot of work but i have nothing but time
0,[03:37] <ZykoticK9> PoPpiLLs, keeping you old home separate from the new install and selectively moving things over is probably your best bet.
0,[03:38] <syrinx_> PoPpiLLs: just github the dotfiles :D
0,[03:38] <k|oWn> my 11.04 cd will not go past the "Ubuntu logo with the scrolling dots". there were 5 dots now there are 4, after i hit escape in the bootup and changed the options to acpi=off, the only thing that changed when attempting to use it, it now theres 4 dots. but they just scroll forever still. any advice to get it going ?
0,[03:39] <ZykoticK9> k|oWn, nomodeset or something similar to that might get you further
0,[03:39] <cntrational> ??
0,[03:40] <k|oWn> Zykotick9 is there not a log ot something that can tell me whats going on behind the dots ?
0,[03:40] <ZykoticK9> k|oWn, removing quiet from the kernel options may show you what is happening (rather then the dots)
0,[03:40] <k|oWn> additional information is that the 10.04 live cd and full install both work just fine on this pc
0,[03:41] <escott> cntrational, once you have a good xrandr you can add a ModeLine to xorg.conf
0,[03:41] <eoss> hello, how do i install a different radeon driver in ubuntu?
0,[03:41] <eoss> 11.4 just came out and i want that one
0,[03:41] <PoPpiLLs> going to run my rsync backup one more time then do a fresh install and move my config files manually after i re-install my apps, thanks every one:-)
0,[03:42] <escott> cntrational, you can try just creating a Modes section, but you may end up having to create lots of supporting sections http://www.x.org/archive/X11R6.8.0/doc/xorg.conf.5.html
0,[03:42] <PoPpiLLs> syrinx_, im going  to check out github to, thanks
0,[03:42] <k|oWn> remove quiet from the kernel options, is this something i can do for the live cd or just with a full install ?
1,[03:42] <DrFrankenstein> Hi, after doing a clean install of Natty, most GTK applications are *not* using the theme I selected in gnome-appearence-properties. Instead, they use a default control style, probably "Raleigh". This happens no matter which theme I choose, including "Ambience", and no matter which desktop I'm using (Unity, Gnome...). Any idea on what would be causing that or where to look to fix it?
0,[03:42] <escott> cntrational, you could see if the xorgconfig scripts will create a xorg.conf for you
0,[03:43] <cntrational> escott: okay, where are the xorgconfig scripts?
0,[03:43] <ZykoticK9> cntrational, do you already have an xorg.conf?
0,[03:43] <cntrational> ZykoticK9: no
0,[03:43] <UbuntuNoob> hi so for some reason my power button is gone from the top right of my desktop in 10.10 on the taskbar and i cant figure how to get it back. any suggestions?
0,[03:44] <francesc1> UbuntuNoob: right click on the panel and click add to panel and add the shutdown button
0,[03:44] <k|oWn> is this cuz i have a friggin nvidia graphics card ? why is it that every error i see with ubuntu in forums and blurbs online, its all about nvidia not working with ubuntu
0,[03:44] <escott> cntrational, Xorg --configure will generate one in the home directory
0,[03:45] <ZykoticK9> cntrational, (from memory only, may miss steps!  THIS WILL LOG YOU OUT!)  - alt+ctrl+f1 to get a VT, "sudo service gdm stop", "sudo X --configure", "sudo cp /root/xorg.* /etc/X11/xorg.conf", "sudo service gdm start" (hope that's correct)
0,[03:45] <UbuntuNoob> thanks
0,[03:45] <francesc1> k|oWn: i never had a problem with my ubuntu and nvidia... i had more issues with ati
0,[03:45] <k|oWn> does the natty try to use the nvidia driver off the bat and the 10.04 vertion would do somethign like a generic driver ? that would explain why i have probs trying to upgrade to 11.04
0,[03:45] <shmup> would anyone be interested in helping me get my mic input working on 11.04? worked on 10.10. did a clean install.
0,[03:45] <Flynsarmy> Just came here to say for anyone wondering: the noveau 3D experimental driver = awesomesauce. After 2 days of usage not a single crash, very smooth (in fact seemingly more smooth than proprietry for me). That is all.
0,[03:45] <k|oWn> im going to go and strangle someone over this
0,[03:45] <Flynsarmy> in natty that is :)
0,[03:45] <k|oWn> wicked klown style
0,[03:46] <escott> shmup, is it intel hda?
0,[03:46] <Flynsarmy> :O you did it!
0,[03:47] <cntrational> escott: oh, that. X -configure and Xorg -configure don't work. I get an error saying "Number of created screens does not match number of detected devices. Configuration failed."
0,[03:47] <UbuntuNoob> also is there a way to rip the songs off of my iphone in ubuntu?
0,[03:47] <ZykoticK9> cntrational, are you using two dashes --configure vs -configure?
0,[03:48] <cntrational> ZykoticK9: yes, I did everything
1,[03:48] <validnickname> hey guys, have ubuntu 11.04 and everything was correct end perfect but now there is no control thin like the bar on top and the bar left
0,[03:48] <cntrational> ZykoticK9: X -configure just doesn't work
0,[03:48] <cntrational> erm
0,[03:48] <cntrational> --configure
0,[03:48] <escott> cntrational, you should edit the generated file and remove the extra screen
1,[03:48] <validnickname> so how could i redo that?
0,[03:48] <Griemak> anyone else trying Gnome3 on Ubuntu 11.04?
0,[03:48] <ZykoticK9> cntrational, did you stop GDM/X in a virtual terminal?
0,[03:48] <validnickname> *undo
0,[03:48] <shmup> escott: no it's an nvidia
0,[03:48] <cntrational> escott: tried that too, it regenerates it again when I try to run
0,[03:48] <cntrational> ZykoticK9: yes
0,[03:48] <shmup> escott: HDA NVidia
0,[03:48] <ZykoticK9> Griemak, many issue with Gnome3 and 11.04 - be careful
0,[03:49] <francesc1> Griemak: YES I have ... completly crashedddd
0,[03:49] <ZykoticK9> cntrational, sorry man, I have no further ideas - best of luck.
0,[03:49] <francesc1> Griemak: I wouldnt try it
0,[03:49] <escott> shmup, nvidia makes audio (for all I know they do, but....) what does lspci say in the lines mentioning sound?
0,[03:49] <litropy_> I'm testing my message notifer. Could someone wait 10 seconds then reply with my name?
0,[03:49] <cntrational> litropy_: hey
0,[03:49] <iggyology> anyone know how to roll back an update that fudged me in xubuntu?
0,[03:49] <hylian> cntrational, fill me in, maybe i can lend an ear, atleaat.
0,[03:49] <validnickname> hey guys your my last hope
1,[03:49] <Griemak> ZykoticK9: No choice... I'm 4 days in without many issues except "popping" sound, dual booting 11.04-Unity and 11.04-GShell
0,[03:49] <slakar> Can someone say if mercury email server will install with wine
0,[03:50] <litropy_> cntrational, thank you.
0,[03:50] <Mac_Weber> Hello
0,[03:50] <eoss> hello, im trying to get the newest radeon hd drivers version 11.04 on my ubuntu 10.10 machine, is this possible
0,[03:50] <validnickname> does someone know how to reset linux ubuntu 11.04 to that time it was bevor one hour?
0,[03:50] <UbuntuNoob> when i tried to add music from my ipod to rhythmbox, i got the error message "the MIME type of the file could not be identified" what does this mean?
0,[03:51] <hylian> slakar never used that e-mail server, but I have noticed some newer apps work only with wine 1.3. i have this problem myself.
0,[03:51] <tarvid> anybody know where the monitor database is?
0,[03:51] <cntrational> hmm
0,[03:51] <escott> UbuntuNoob, it doesn't recognize the file extension (basically) what files are these
0,[03:51] <burzum__> Hi
0,[03:51] <Griemak> UbuntuNoob: have you installed Ubuntu-Restricted-Extras package?
0,[03:51] <ZykoticK9> validnickname, linux doesn't have an equivalent to "System Restore" (ZFS filesystem does, but that's not linux-native)
0,[03:51] <UbuntuNoob> escott: theyre all mp3 :/
0,[03:51] <zarbula> Ubuntu, Just put a PCI x-fi card I had around, works but it makes this static noise every 6 secs or so.  Any clues how to troubleshoot that?
0,[03:51] <UbuntuNoob> Griemak: i dont think so, ill check
0,[03:52] <validnickname> i just wana reset the settings
0,[03:52] <hylian> eoss, that's too hard a question to answer, because the drivers are very specific to your hardware. the card name and model number would be needed just to try and answer that.
0,[03:52] <validnickname> because otherwise i have to boot linux ubuntu again because i dont know how to fix this error
0,[03:52] <eoss> hylian: 04:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV770 [Radeon HD 4870]
0,[03:52] <eoss>     how i get other info for you?
0,[03:53] <escott> UbuntuNoob, legally in the USA you are supposed to pay royalties to various people to use mp3 or watch dvds so you get stuff like that
0,[03:53] <Griemak> validnickname: which package update failed?  Have you tried the following from a terminal window:  sudo apt-get -f install
0,[03:53] <UbuntuNoob> Griemak: it wasnt installed, but what is this microsoft end-user agreement im getting?>
0,[03:54] <eoss> apparently the upgrade is an auto install in ubuntu 11.04 im curious if i can download it for 10.10..if its just a hardware issue then im sure i can
0,[03:54] <validnickname> why packackupdate?
0,[03:54] <hylian> eoss, well before we continue, have you tried to install a proprietary driver from system->administration->hardware drivers?
0,[03:54] <Griemak> UbuntuNoob: it is an agreement that the True-Type Fonts that are being installed will not be altered by you and resold
1,[03:54] <validnickname> the bar on top is away and the bar left
0,[03:54] <cntrational> yeah, no, X -configure still doesn't work
1,[03:54] <validnickname> so there is nothing
0,[03:54] <UbuntuNoob> Griemak: uhh... sureee haha
0,[03:54] <Griemak> Validnickname: the command I provided will force apt to fix broken packages
0,[03:55] <eoss> hylian: yes,  it says im using the proprietary FGLRX graphics driver but its not finding the upgrade
0,[03:55] <Mac_Weber> I can reach http://myIP:8083 but http://localhost:8083. nmap -p 8083 -sT localhost says it is closed
0,[03:55] <validnickname> it is like before
0,[03:56] <escott> cntrational, but it is generating an xorg.conf yes?
0,[03:56] <cntrational> escott: no, it isn't
0,[03:56] <hylian> eoss, so there is an upgrade to that driver?
0,[03:56] <validnickname> that mean that there is nothing
0,[03:56] <cdavis> escott: The language was set to chrome:/blahblah intl
0,[03:56] <cdavis> escott: I changed to English and it works fine now, thanks
0,[03:56] <eoss> hylian: yes, there is but it seems to be only for ubuntu 11.04 users?
0,[03:56] <francesc1> Does anyone in here know of a IM client similar to something that of Gnome3
0,[03:57] <validnickname> does someone know how to oben the sytemsettign thing via terminal
0,[03:57] <eoss> lots of articles like this hylian :How to Install AMD Catalyst 11.4 Graphics Driver for Linux in Ubuntu 11.04
0,[03:57] <eoss> i want to do it for 10.10 was wondering if it will work
0,[03:57] <hylian> eoss, does the hardware driver tool show the version being 11.3 or 11.4 for a driver number?
0,[03:57] <validnickname> *open
0,[03:57] <UbuntuNoob> now my error is that rhythmbox "didnt get a playback URI"
0,[03:57] <UbuntuNoob> what does that mean?
0,[03:58] <eoss> hylian , no version number visible
0,[03:58] <Griemak> francesc1: Gnome3 and Ubuntu 11.04 both use Empathy
0,[03:58] <validnickname> all controls are away!!! :(
0,[03:58] <validnickname> i couldnt move windows with mouse
0,[03:58] <torchie> how can i, with nautilus, just give all users read/write access to a folder and everything inside of it?
0,[03:58] <francesc1> Griemak: i know.. but i am not using 11.04
0,[03:58] <hylian> eoss, an article can list a driver, but that does not mean it will be in the hardware driver area. sometimes because it's buggy, sometimes because it's so new. But it's never set to just one version of ubuntu. it's not made by canaonical, the ubuntu people.
1,[03:58] <Griemak> validnickname: perhaps Compiz has crashed, have you tried reboot or are you afraid it may not come back?
0,[03:58] <escott> validnickname, hold down alt while clicking
0,[03:59] <torchie> even if I click "apply to all enclosed files"
0,[03:59] <torchie> it doesn't work
0,[03:59] <hylian> eoss, what you will have to do is decide on whether you are happy with this driver, or whether you are willing to take a chance on the new driver, we can go from there.
0,[03:59] <francesc1> Griemak: i like the whole idea of messeging from the notification window... so i thought there may be an equivalent for gnome 2
0,[03:59] <Mac_Weber> I can reach http://myIP:8083 but http://localhost:8083. nmap -p 8083 -sT localhost says it is closed. How to close it for external and open for localhost?
0,[03:59] <eoss> hylian: i would like to take the chance on the new driver
0,[03:59] <escott> francesc1, thats a new gnome3 feature
0,[04:00] <hylian> eoss, ok, is your version of ubuntu 32 bit or 64 bit.?
0,[04:00] <francesc1> escott: I am aware... just wondering if there was something similar to it out there
0,[04:00] <eoss> hylian 64 bit
0,[04:00] <escott> Mac_Weber, iptables see gufw
0,[04:00] <escott> francesc1, not that im aware of
0,[04:00] <GarryFre> I tried looking up to see what this "Install Release" thing is in the new ubuntu.... but as many can guess, I got info about anything but what the heck is "Install Release".
0,[04:00] <GarryFre> google is my frenemy
0,[04:00] <francesc1> escott: well it was worth a shit :P
0,[04:00] <francesc1> SHOT**
1,[04:01] <validnickname> you mean she super key yeah thats who i do it now but i want my controls like close the window with clicking on cross ( the top bar auf a window is also away)
0,[04:01] <cntrational> blah
0,[04:01] <cntrational> this is tiring
0,[04:01] <k|oWn> so im trying to load the new 11.04 live cd. it wont go past the loading screen with the scrolling dots and the ubuntu logo.  i have tried acpi=no and nomodeset also. and have tried getting rid of quiet out of the kernel options.  these things do not change anything, as when i tell it to try without installing, it just goes to the forever scrolling dots. could this be possible if i had a bad copy on my CD ?
1,[04:01] <goddard> so to go to a window that is minimized instead of just one click to open it you have to do two
0,[04:01] <Griemak> validnickname: have you tried to switch your theme to something else then back to the one you want?
0,[04:01] <hylian> eoss, then this is where the driver is, you will have to download this first, and then if you need help installing it I will try and walk you through it. Also, you will need to uninstall your current driver before installing the new one, which will most likely need a restart.
0,[04:02] <torchie> is it possible?
0,[04:02] <hylian> eoss, http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&product=2.4.1.3.42&lang=English
0,[04:02] <torchie> or am I gonna have to chmod yet again
1,[04:02] <validnickname> i think that right Compiz has crashed
0,[04:02] <eoss> hey that says 11.3
0,[04:02] <goddard> everyone they are making your stuff cloud ready
0,[04:02] <eoss> oh. revision number
0,[04:02] <hylian> eoss, revision number is 11.04.
0,[04:03] <GarryFre> like I really want to trust all my info to the cloud.
0,[04:03] <eoss> saving and also uninstalling hylian
1,[04:03] <brophat> anyone have problems when firefox is loaded up with tabs the window will not stay in the doc and keeps popping out
0,[04:03] <hylian> eoss, this is the latest driver for your card, it's from ati itself.
0,[04:03] <validnickname> how could i switch my theme?
0,[04:03] <sweb> i have a problem in gnome  with my netbook  for larg windows some of buttons and other options is outside of screen size how can i access them ?
0,[04:03] <__import__> We;;, I got it figured out, kinda
0,[04:03] <MagusOTB> if I don't play 3d games and don't use a compositing windowmanager is there any benefit to using the ATI proprietary driver
0,[04:04] <MagusOTB> like for decoding HD video or something?
0,[04:04] <hylian> validnickname, if you right click the desktop, (assuming your using gnome 2) you then choose change background, and then use the theme tab.
0,[04:04] <researcher> I can listen to sound but cant record.How to correct this?
0,[04:04] <__import__> Had to use the last post of http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=365652
1,[04:04] <Griemak> validnickname: try to Alt-F2 and type: Compiz --replace     (that's 2 dashes --)
0,[04:04] <tarvid> MagusOTB, simple things like moving windows will be much better with the driver
0,[04:04] <hiexpo> validnickname, just right click on desktop click change daesktop backtop back ground
0,[04:04] <evxd> sweb, can you just move the window and click the buttons? hold alt+click and drag to move the window if you can't reach the bar.
0,[04:04] <Osmodivs> Hello. What's the name of the program wich takes care of shutting down the system? I am tryin to file a bug report with ubuntu-bug <name of the program>
0,[04:04] <__import__> escott, DocPlatypus, etc, thansk for your help
0,[04:05] <escott> MagusOTB, maybe but i dont think they enabled most of the video features for the linux drivers and most linux utilities are not written to take advantage of them
0,[04:05] <evxd> Osmo, that'd be init.
0,[04:05] <eoss> hylian: uninstalled and new driver downloaded, lets proceed
0,[04:05] <burzum__> -there is any solution to use emerald in natty narwhal?
0,[04:05] <hylian> eoss, one other thing, there is a chance that you already had 11.03 rev 11.04 already installed, and ubuntu's hardware driver tool just left out the rev number, i hope not, or you will just be installing the driver you are uninstalling.
0,[04:05] <hylian> eoss, ok, what is the extension? is it .run?
0,[04:05] <eoss> yep
0,[04:06] <escott> Osmodivs, upstart maybe, what is the bug exactly?
0,[04:06] <sweb> evxd, the window is larger than my screen. in windows 7 you can scroll the current window in netbooks. gnome have same feature ?
0,[04:06] <validnickname> ok i changed the theme, nothing happend, alt-f2?? i did it on desktop and in terminal
0,[04:06] <Osmodivs> escott: http://pastebin.com/2HPbaRFd
0,[04:06] <researcher> !rcord
0,[04:06] <researcher> !record
0,[04:06] <tensorpudding> sweb: the window is larger than your screen? try maximizing it
0,[04:07] <hylian> eoss, i would first change the name of the driver to something easy like ati, but that's up to you. now let's go to the terminal (control alt t) and then type sudo nameoffile.run
0,[04:07] <researcher> !sound
0,[04:07] <ubottu> If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
0,[04:07] <hylian> eoss, oops sudo sh nameoffile.run
1,[04:07] <validnickname> but alt-f2 and then Compiz --replace, nothing happend
0,[04:07] <tensorpudding> sweb: you can move the window around by holding the alt key, and click-dragging with the mouse
0,[04:07] <eoss> hylian: installing
1,[04:08] <validnickname> so how could i restore that?
0,[04:08] <sweb>  evxd, tensorpudding. tnx @}"-
0,[04:08] <escott> Osmodivs, is your concern the ptrace warning?
0,[04:09] <eoss> hylian: install complete. i thank you good sir
0,[04:09] <eoss> gonna restart
0,[04:09] <escott> sweb, it is possible to have that, but most people don't use it
0,[04:09] <hylian> eoss, don't delete that driver though untill after reboot, in case something went honkey you can use that file to remove.
0,[04:09] <hylian> oh well
0,[04:09] <Osmodivs> escott, Well, it's a bug, i thought it would be a good Idea to report it
1,[04:09] <validnickname> Griemak: do yoiu have a idea how to restore that?
0,[04:10] <escott> sweb, i think it would be considered part of xinerama
0,[04:10] <tbrew13> can i have some help please
1,[04:10] <Griemak> validnickname: relog/reboot
0,[04:10] <validnickname> whats relog?
0,[04:10] <hylian> validnickname, sorry man, i thought you where using plain' ole ubuntu. i never monkey with compiz. i always set all my desktop setting to no graphics pretty-ness.
0,[04:10] <tbrew13> ok can someone help me please
0,[04:11] <Pokit> Hello.  I just upgraded to ubuntu 11, and when I switch viewports (using desktop wall), the wallpaper and everything shifts.  i can't find anything in CCSM that lets me tell it to just move the windows when switching viewports
1,[04:11] <Griemak> hylian: Unity uses Compiz as WM
0,[04:11] <hylian> tbrew13, please ask the question, man.
0,[04:11] <escott> Osmodivs, well i guess it would go under ptrace/upstart maybe ptrace isn't being shut down early enough by upstart
0,[04:11] <validnickname> i rebooted already
0,[04:11] <hylian> Griemak, ohh, yeah, i am also using lts. i like updating my os only once every 3 years.
0,[04:11] <validnickname> Griemak: but how to reboot
0,[04:12] <validnickname> no
0,[04:12] <hylian> !hello | tbrew13
1,[04:12] <tbrew13> hylian, simple question how do i add icons to desktop i tried dragging the firefox icon from the unity toolbar no go, and i don't know how else to add them also i cant get compiz desktop cube to work with unity or wobbly windows
0,[04:12] <anthony_> which channel is a help channel?
0,[04:12] <validnickname> how to relog soory ^^
0,[04:12] <Griemak> log out, log back in :)
0,[04:12] <escott> sweb, it may also be the panning option to xrandr
0,[04:12] <validnickname> |-(
0,[04:12] <validnickname> how could i lock out?
1,[04:12] <hylian> tbrew13, unity does not allow you to change the desktop. to do that, atleast for now, you will have to go back to ubuntu classic mode, which uses gnome 2.
1,[04:13] <validnickname> Griemak: there is no bar on the top
0,[04:13] <k|oWn> it doesnt allow you to add icons ?
0,[04:13] <escott> sweb, i think most netbooks people just maximize everything and use virtual desktops instead (ctrl-alt-left/right/up/down)
1,[04:13] <tbrew13> hylian, can i login to classic change the desktop then log back into unity and unity wont allow icons really
0,[04:14] <validnickname> hey does someone know how to log out via terminal?
0,[04:14] <francesc1> tbrew13: yup.. hylian is right ... thats why i switched back to 10.10
1,[04:14] <hylian> tbrew13, you can, but it wont change unity. they are not one and the same.
0,[04:14] <hylian> francesc1, but you can go back to gnome 2 on 11.04...
1,[04:15] <Griemak> validnickname: try alt-F2 and type: Unity --replace     before full reboot, just to see if it fixes it
0,[04:15] <caputoboy1> i have ubuntu 11.04 installed on my netbook, and want to remove it. it's not dualbooted, and i'm really lost in trying to remove it. i've tried booting windows XP off of the USB, but it wouldn't run, and the file doesn't work through WINE. any ideas/help?
0,[04:15] <hylian> francesc1, i am the same though man, i use 10.04. i like to stay with the lts versions.
1,[04:15] <tbrew13> hylian okay unity is nice and all but what is with all the limits gosh it kinda sucks anyway how do i get rid of unity i dont want it taking up space
0,[04:15] <sweb> escott, interest
1,[04:15] <francesc1> hylian: i realise that... but after unity, i tried th gnome3 shell, things just went downhill from there lol
0,[04:15] <sgaap> validnickname: exit
1,[04:15] <hylian> tbrew13, i first suggest loggin out and then into ubuntu classic mode, from there you can remove unity using synaptic,
0,[04:16] <validnickname> thats the command to quit terminal
0,[04:16] <bikcmp> hi all
0,[04:16] <hylian> francesc1, yeah, I am not a fan of gnome 3 either.
0,[04:16] <eoss> hylian: thanks for the help, i have 11.04 but my original problem still exists =[ no portal 2
0,[04:16] <tbrew13> caputoboy1, why do you want to remove it if it is to install ubuntu 10.10 then just put that on a pen drive and downgrade
0,[04:16] <bikcmp> i just upgraded to ubuntu 11.
1,[04:16] <bikcmp> i hate the dock.
1,[04:16] <bikcmp> ideas on removing it?
1,[04:16] <tbrew13> hylian, are their other programs like unity
1,[04:16] <escott> !classic | bikcmp
1,[04:16] <ubottu> bikcmp: The default interface in Ubuntu 11.04 is !Unity. You can switch back to regular !Gnome by logging out and clicking on your user name, in the Session box at the bottom of the screen select Ubuntu Classic.
1,[04:16] <Griemak> validnickname: try to restart unity by Alt-F2 then type:  Unity --replace
1,[04:16] <tbrew13> bikcmp, just answered log in to classic remove unity using synaptic
0,[04:17] <hylian> tbrew13, yes, but just out of curiosity, why can't portal 2 run in gnome 2, for instance...?
0,[04:17] <caputoboy1> i have ubuntu 11.04 installed on my netbook, and want to remove it. it's not dualbooted, and i'm really lost in trying to remove it. i've tried booting windows XP off of the USB, but it wouldn't run, and the file doesn't work through WINE. any ideas/help?
1,[04:17] <tbrew13> ok hylian but does that mean that i cant log into regular ubuntu i have to run classic all the time or once i remove unity will ubuntu go back to normal
1,[04:18] <tbrew13> hold up ill try that hey will i still have programs i installed while using unity
0,[04:18] <sgaap> validnickname: you can use "logout" if you like that better ;)
0,[04:18] <validnickname> Griemak: i dont understand the thing with alt-f2 where should i be while i press alt-f2
0,[04:18] <pamela> how can i run a terminal command every automatically on system startup?
1,[04:18] <escott> tbrew13, don't remove unity thats badness
0,[04:18] <caputoboy1> i have ubuntu 11.04 installed on my netbook, and want to remove it. it's not dualbooted, and i'm really lost in trying to remove it. i've tried booting windows XP off of the USB, but it wouldn't run, and the file doesn't work through WINE. any ideas/help?
1,[04:18] <mike23pizzo> Hello, I just upgraded to ubuntu 11.04 and all my animations are gone.  No more 3D cube, no more wiggle windows, and the theme looks like an old windows type.  Can someone help me get it back to the way it was?
0,[04:18] <|ntegra|> hi, does anyone know how to open a 'really big' .rar file? (i'm getting 'file too large' error, and apparently free rar tool is limited for size?)
1,[04:18] <tbrew13> escott, why
0,[04:18] <Griemak> validnickname: when you press Alt-F2, does an input text box appear?
0,[04:18] <hylian> tbrew13, as far as regular ubuntu goes, if you where running 10.10, then classic is what you where running. classic  is not dumbed down, it's just the tried and true version, using good ole gnome 2.
0,[04:18] <validnickname> no
1,[04:18] <tbrew13> mike23pizzo, those don't work with unity
1,[04:19] <escott> tbrew13, removing unity might suck in a lot of desktop stuff you need and leave you without a desktop
0,[04:19] <Griemak> validnickname: can you get to a terminal window?
1,[04:19] <tbrew13> hylian, i want to get rid on unity to save space escott
0,[04:19] <validnickname> Griemak: no
0,[04:19] <validnickname> yes
1,[04:19] <tensorpudding> you want to get rid of unity to save space?
0,[04:19] <awesomestman> hi. I'm trying to reinstall 11.04 (I think I had some troubles with the first install) and I'm trying to dual boot it. Is it ok if I get some advice just to make sure i'm not destroying my computer or anything?
1,[04:19] <escott> tbrew13, be very selective about packages you remove then
1,[04:19] <tensorpudding> unity isn't really taking up space
0,[04:19] <validnickname> i made a shortcut for that window
0,[04:19] <Griemak> validnickname: to shutdown, type this:  sudo shutdown -h now
1,[04:19] <mike23pizzo> tbrew13, so what does unity do?  I'm very new to ubuntu
0,[04:19] <tbrew13> hylian googleing for a guide okay be right back
0,[04:19] <giacomo_c> so, i upgraded to 11.04x64 and i changed my username slightly, how can i copy my old username's directory to my new username's directory?
0,[04:19] <giacomo_c> just cp -r?
0,[04:19] <validnickname> i already rebooted
0,[04:20] <tbrew13> escott, are there other docs i can use
0,[04:20] <imgx64> I'm installing Ubuntu from the alternate CD, in "Select a language" page, what's the difference between "C - No localization" and "English - English"?
0,[04:20] <Jeffsi> hey, i wad trying to install ubuntu server 64 latest verson on an old computer i have but for some reason on boot from cd it is showing a black screen with a blinking text line thing, any ideas what could be happening?
1,[04:20] <hylian> tbrew13, escott has a point. I removed unity without any problems, but that was 10.10. I am not certain of what bad after affects you may recieve in 11.04. maybe non, maybe no desktop.
0,[04:20] <validnickname> Griemak: why reboot again?
0,[04:20] <Ademan> so what's the deal with sun-java in 11.04?
1,[04:21] <njbair> Whenever I open a context menu or a tooltip appears it causes unity to "blank out" for a second. What should I do?
0,[04:21] <Griemak> validnickname: you were still asking how to reboot, I was not aware you succeeded in the last 2 minutes
0,[04:21] <k|oWn> why would ubuntu get stuck on the splash screen with the scrolling dots with 11.04 but it works fine with 10.04 ?
0,[04:21] <caputoboy1> i have ubuntu 11.04 installed on my netbook, and want to remove it. it's not dualbooted, and i'm really lost in trying to remove it. i've tried booting windows XP off of the USB, but it wouldn't run, and the file doesn't work through WINE. any ideas/help?
1,[04:21] <tbrew13> hylian, the ubuntu unity won't work but classic should
0,[04:21] <tbrew13> trying itr
0,[04:21] <validnickname> Griemak: the first thing i did after the error was rebooting my system
0,[04:22] <validnickname> the first thing i did after the error was rebooting my system
0,[04:22] <triz> caputoboy1: you want to reinstall windows?
1,[04:22] <Griemak> validnickname: did you get an error? or are you just missing your window decorations?
1,[04:22] <hylian> tbrew13, yes, classic is what 10.10 was running, gnome 2. it's there because currently it's way more stable, and in a lot of cases, way more liked than unity.
1,[04:22] <mike23pizzo> So I get that unity won't allow wiggly windows or the 3D cube, but how do I change this old school looking theme?
0,[04:22] <Jeffsi> anyone know anything about why i could be getting a black screen on CD boot of ubuntu server?
0,[04:22] <mrdeb> Jeffsi: broadcom wifi
0,[04:23] <validnickname> Griemak: i just wana have linux ubuntu like it was one hour ago
0,[04:23] <Corey> validnickname: You can't go back again.
0,[04:23] <Jeffsi> mrdeb: broadcom wifi? what do you mean?
1,[04:23] <imgx64> mike23pizzo: Unity does allow wiggly windows, I have them right now.
1,[04:23] <validnickname> Griemak: error?
1,[04:23] <validnickname> Griemak: the ting said tht there is an error with unity
0,[04:23] <mrdeb> Jeffsi: drivers sometimes make it dfreze
0,[04:23] <awesomestman> I already have Ubuntu 11.04 installed and apparently I'm supposed to partition my hard drive because the original partition wasn't large enough
0,[04:23] <hylian> k|oWn, not certain. you can hit escape just as ubuntu is starting too boot, there are some troubleshooting options there. without more info however, it could be many many things.
0,[04:23] <giacomo_c> how do i go about copying userA under my /home to userB
0,[04:23] <cntrational> fish fish fishy fish
1,[04:24] <mike23pizzo> imgx64, I was just told it doesn't allow them.  How do I get them?
0,[04:24] <Jeffsi> wait so how would i go aboutt fixing this?
1,[04:24] <sgaap> validnickname: just log into the classic environment when you are at the login screen (instead of unity)
0,[04:24] <awesomestman> I just want to make sure I go and shrink my windows partition without messing anything up
1,[04:24] <imgx64> mike23pizzo: Use CompizConfig Settings Manager (apt-get install ccsm).
0,[04:24] <giacomo_c> awesomestman, make sure you defrag first
0,[04:25] <giacomo_c> maybe do that  a few times
0,[04:25] <|ntegra|> hi, does anyone know how to open a 'really big' .rar file? (i'm getting 'file too large' error, and apparently free rar tool is limited for size?)
1,[04:25] <mike23pizzo> imgx64, I have that, but everytime I enable the cube I lose my entire desktop
0,[04:25] <validnickname> so how to logout?
0,[04:25] <validnickname> sgaap: so how to logout?
0,[04:25] <hylian> validnickname, and if your are a no password booter, then you can log out at your name to the top right
0,[04:25] <k|oWn> hylian, i did hit escape, tried removing quiet-splash, and acpi=no and nomodeset. to no avail . still hangs at the scrolling dots splash screen. how can i gather more info ?
1,[04:25] <rmatte> imgx64: it's actually apt-get compizconfig-settings-manager
0,[04:25] <awesomestman> all right. so I'll defrag and then reinstall?

0,[04:26] <jmwpc> Running 11.04, shutdown from the menu does not power off, however 'shutdown -P now' from the command line does. (Already added acpi=force to /etc/default/grub)
0,[04:26] <awesomestman> reinstall 11.04.
0,[04:26] <imgx64> rmatte: oops, yes, you're right.
0,[04:26] <k|oWn> hylian thank you

0,[04:26] <giacomo_c> and your partitions are already setup awesomestman ?
0,[04:26] <EnigmaticCoder> Anyone know of a good open source UML diagramming tool? I've tried dia and umbrello and wasn't thrilled
0,[04:26] <Jeffsi> member:mrdeb: wait so how would i go aboutt fixing this?
0,[04:26] <validnickname> logout of my account to get to the login screen
1,[04:26] <imgx64> mike23pizzo: I don't know about the cube, I was talking about wiggly windows, sorry.
0,[04:26] <rmatte> EnigmaticCoder: I've tried every one that I could find and they all suck
0,[04:27] <EnigmaticCoder> rmatte: Even outside the repositories?
0,[04:27] <sgaap> validnickname: do you autologin?
0,[04:27] <rmatte> EnigmaticCoder: yes, even outside the repos
0,[04:27] <Griemak> rmatte: have you tried 7-zip?
0,[04:27] <validnickname> sgaap: logout of my account to get to the login screen
0,[04:27] <ByteMr> Anyone know if any updates/fixes are incoming for the wireless problems? I use ath5k and have nohwcrypt=1 in modprobe.d but it's 50-50 on boot whether it works or not - I never had any problems with 10.04 or 10.10 and 11.04 update it's nothing but problems
0,[04:27] <EnigmaticCoder> rmatte: What do you do? Design on paper?
0,[04:27] <rmatte> EnigmaticCoder: I went on a google-thon for one one day
1,[04:27] <mike23pizzo> imgx64, It's all good.  Would you mind walking me through how you did it?  If not I can take a look at that site that was just given to me
0,[04:27] <Jeffsi> mrdeb: wait so how would i go aboutt fixing this?
0,[04:27] <rmatte> EnigmaticCoder: no, I run visio inside a windows VM
0,[04:27] <mike23pizzo> If PM would be easier that is imgx64
0,[04:27] <mikinanuq> where is bashrc now? need to add a path..
0,[04:27] <sgaap> validnickname, do you autologin, if not just select the ubuntu classic environment when you are at your login screen
0,[04:28] <EnigmaticCoder> rmatte: Does visio still cost money?
0,[04:28] <awesomestman> giacomo_c: i think my partitions are set up. I was able to dual boot yesterday. I have been having issues with software center so I was told to downgrade to 10.04 last night. I didn't know if just reinstalling 11.04 would change anything
0,[04:28] <validnickname> sgaap: i do
0,[04:28] <rmatte> EnigmaticCoder: yeh it does, our company has licenses for it
0,[04:28] <EnigmaticCoder> rmatte: Thank you for your help
0,[04:28] <rmatte> no prob
0,[04:28] <improveupon> after my screen saver is activated my computer does not display fields for authentication. you can only see the mouse pointer. like 1/3 of the time this happens.
0,[04:28] <awesomestman> I thought it would so I wanted to go with it but when I tried to boot the install from my USB I was told that Ubuntu's partition was too small.
0,[04:29] <sgaap> validnickname: you said you can use a console, just do sudo gdmsetup and disable autologin
0,[04:29] <hylian> k|oWn, there is a way to get at a file and change that, and then you can see the startup data, but since your are currently stuck... try going into those options and booting with x in safe graphics mode. that should atleast get you back to your desktop, if not, we atleast ruled out the graphics driver
0,[04:29] <Jeffsi> what does a black screen mean when booting to ubuntu server?
0,[04:29] <giacomo_c> as long as your partitions are already setup awesomestman, you can just go ahead and reinstall, just make sure you don't choose the option to use the whole drive, make sure its just reinstalling on your ubuntu partition (ext4 or whatever)
0,[04:29] <rmatte> When I play flash videos in natty I get white squares flashing inside the video... anyone know how to fix that?
0,[04:29] <hylian> validnickname, wow. hmm, give me a second
0,[04:30] <rmatte> It does it with every video I've tried except for youtube videos
0,[04:30] <caputoboy1> i recently installed ubuntu 11.04 on my netbook, because i heard it was an interesting thing to try, and now i want to remove it. i wasn't thinking, and didn't dual boot, and now i have no way of removing it, because of the lack of a CD drive. i have a flash drive with windows XP ready to be installed, but it won't boot off of the USB, and the file doesn't work correctly. any help ideas?
0,[04:30] <rmatte> youtube works fine
0,[04:30] <validnickname> so? what now?
0,[04:30] <Griemak> rmatte: which browser, flash, and video card driver are you using?
0,[04:30] <giacomo_c> awesomestman, you want to have at least 5g for your root partition
0,[04:30] <sgaap> validnickname: did you disable autologin?
0,[04:30] <awesomestman> giacomo_c: should I reformat my hard disc beforehand or should I just go with it?
0,[04:30] <giacomo_c> wait, you have windows installed too, yes?
0,[04:31] <awesomestman> My laptop's off right now and my USB's out
0,[04:31] <k|oWn> hylian, you know this is a live cd im trying to get to work, right ? im currently using 10.10 on my dualbooted machine.
0,[04:31] <awesomestman> I don't know if my first step is to boot from Windows, 11.04, or from the live USB
1,[04:31] <imgx64> mike23pizzo: Just enable "Wobbly Windows" in the Effects section in CompizConfig Settings Manager. If it asks you to disable snapping windows, disable it.
0,[04:31] <wilson> guys, need some help here
0,[04:31] <rmatte> Griemak: firefox-4.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1 nvidia-current-270.41.06-0ubuntu1 flashplugin-nonfree-10.2.159.1ubuntu1

0,[04:35] <GarryFre> hmm looks like some spammers have too much time on their hands
0,[04:35] <manlymatt83> I'm having trouble with 11.04 and usb-switchmode... I keep getting: Aargh! Config file missing for 19d2:1201! Exiting
0,[04:35] <sgaap> validnickname: if you change the gdmsetup, restart, pick the ubuntu classic desktop and login it will look like before
0,[04:35] <guampa> w0w
0,[04:35] <manlymatt83> But I have a config file set..
0,[04:35] <ouyes> Guest
0,[04:36] <Jeffsi> can somone let me know if they are able to help me install ubuntu server
0,[04:36] <Guest7301> edbian: it says that it is active but not in use
0,[04:36] <rmatte> Jeffsi: there's really not much to it man
0,[04:36] <edbian> Guest7301: hang on
0,[04:36] <tarvid> askubuntu sucks
0,[04:36] <edbian> tbrew13: hang on
0,[04:36] <tbrew13> okay edbian you there i found a temporary fix I typed metacity into terminal
0,[04:36] <tarvid>  mailto doesn't work
0,[04:36] <Mac_Weber> I can reach http://myIP:8083 but http://localhost:8083. nmap -p 8083 -sT localhost says it is closed. How to close it for internet and open for localhost?
0,[04:36] <Griemak> rmatte: I have the same driver, flash, and browser and am not experiencing the white squares :(  Can you run OpenGL applications without artifacts?
0,[04:36] <tarvid> and you have to have reputation points to provide feedback
0,[04:37] <rmatte> Griemak: yes, I was playing minecraft earlier without any problems
0,[04:37] <validnickname> sgaap: i already sai that in that gdmsetup window everything is disabled
1,[04:37] <hylian> validnickname, sorry, i know of a comand for gnome, but for unity... what do you have available to you?
0,[04:37] <edbian> tbrew13: metacity is a window manager.  It does not have fancy effects.  Compiz is a window manager.  It does do fancy affects.  You cannot have both at once.
0,[04:38] <sgaap> validnickname: then you didnt use sudo to start it
0,[04:38] <validnickname> i did
0,[04:38] <eoss> anyone know why graphics card would make a game flicker parts of the screen black..im using ati radeon hd 4870 driver version 11.04
0,[04:38] <olskolirc> is there any truth to that spam message please?
0,[04:38] <validnickname> sgaap: i did
0,[04:38] <Griemak> rmatte: there was a Firefox 4 add-on for flash on Linux that used a script to change settings and download a "fixed" NSWrapper.  I didn't trust it, personally, but it has many users and seems safe for the non-paranoid, lol.
0,[04:38] <eoss> very rapid flicker
0,[04:38] <sgaap> validnickname: did you use unlock?
0,[04:38] <edbian> tbrew13: go into ccsm -> window decoration  (this should be checked).  Inside the decorator plugin you should have command: /usr/bin/compiz-decorator in the general tab
0,[04:38] <tbrew13> edbian, compiz broke and i lost windows all together xchat said i had no window manager running so i type metacity to get basic windows back
0,[04:39] <edbian> Guest7301: You can use sudo lspci -k to see which driver is really being used.  That gui app is buggy and often lies
0,[04:39] <edbian> tbrew13: type compiz --replace&  to get compiz back temporarily
0,[04:39] <rmatte> Griemak: ok, I'll try to find that
0,[04:39] <b1lly> im having trouble, i moved from my house and now my ubuntu wont connect to the internet at this location
0,[04:39] <validnickname> sgaap: there is a unlock butten but when i clicked on it nothing happend
0,[04:39] <b1lly> its not automatically detecting nore can if ugre out how to make it
0,[04:39] <edbian> tbrew13: Or system -> preferences -> appearances -> desktop effects -> extra || normal
0,[04:39] <sgaap> validnickname: it doesnt work for me either tbh, let me check
0,[04:40] <rmatte> Griemak: hmmm, do you remember what it was called?  Just tried googling for it but no luck.
0,[04:40] <edbian> tbrew13: The window decorations are the border around windows.  They have the x + and - buttons in them along with the title of the app.
0,[04:40] <tbrew13> edbian, huh you lost me on go into ccsm
0,[04:40] <hylian> tbrew13, so how did it go?
0,[04:40] <edbian> tbrew13: compizconfig-settings-manager = ccsm.  You installed it yes?
0,[04:40] <tbrew13> hylian, it sucked compiz does not work
1,[04:40] <MNichie> I just upgraded to 11.04 and I have two monitors.  The Unity main menu(no idea what the proper name is) is displaying in the wrong monitor.  Anybody know a way to move it?
0,[04:41] <tbrew13> yes im in it but where is window decoration
0,[04:41] <Guest7301> edbian: nvidia-173
0,[04:41] <edbian> tbrew13: It's under 'effects'
0,[04:41] <hylian> tbrew13, compiz is defaultly turned off in gnome 2, maybe you have to activate it?
0,[04:41] <dfcnvt> Does this channel play in the loop? It seems every time I join back in ubuntu channel. It always about compiz.
0,[04:41] <tbrew13> edbian, okay checked
0,[04:41] <tbrew13> now what
0,[04:42] <hylian> dfcnvt, many people ask the same questions, mostly about compiz, yes. glad i dont mess with it.
0,[04:42] <edbian> Guest7301: That's a proprietary driver.  Here is a list of all packages that contain drivers for nvidia.  I'm not sure of the difference between 173 and 96 and such but nouveau is the open source driver
0,[04:42] <tbrew13> compiz is still not running havent entered the command
0,[04:42] <edbian> tbrew13: What is the command in the box if you go into the settings for window decorations?
0,[04:42] <brophat> anyone have problems with firefox not staying in doc when it is loaded with tabs?
0,[04:42] <edbian> tbrew13: We'll make sure the decorations are set up then we'll turn on compiz
0,[04:42] <roasted_> hi
0,[04:43] <tbrew13> edbian, /usr/bin/compiz-decorator
0,[04:43] <hylian> !hi | Roasted
0,[04:43] <edbian> hylian: What have you tried?
0,[04:43] <edbian> tbrew13: And if you do compiz --replace&  in a terminal?
0,[04:43] <hylian> roasted_, hello
0,[04:43] <tbrew13> on it do i exit out of metacity terminal window
0,[04:44] <tomasm-> hi, i just upgraded some gl/nvidia drivers and now my mouse is stuck on the left side of my screen... moving it right just makes it bounce back to the left edge... any idea whats wrong?
0,[04:44] <edbian> tbrew13: Doesn't matter.  The replace option will take care of things.
0,[04:44] <Jeffsi> anyone know why i may be getting a black screen with a blinking curser when booting from cd?
0,[04:44] <edbian> tbrew13: If you're unable to type things in the metacity window try pressing ctrl + c first
1,[04:44] <hylian> edbian, all i did is got tbrew13 out of unity. so i haven't tried anything yet with compiz.
1,[04:44] <edbian> hylian: Ahh
1,[04:44] <edbian> hylian: He hated unity
0,[04:44] <Griemak> Jeffsi: your CD burn was bad
0,[04:44] <dfcnvt> edbian, You're running LiveCD?
0,[04:44] <edbian> dfcnvt: I am running Debian sir
0,[04:44] <hylian> edbian, yeah, most people do. that will change eventually.
0,[04:45] <roasted_> hylian, hi?
0,[04:45] <dfcnvt> Play with F1, F2 to see the change
0,[04:45] <edbian> hylian: I think many people here in the channel don't like it.  But many love it and just aren't saying anything
0,[04:45] <hylian> roasted_, again, hello back. you said hi first.
0,[04:45] <edbian> roasted_: Hello?
0,[04:45] <dfcnvt> if nothing happen, try (Ctrl + Alt +F1)
0,[04:45] <Guest7301> edbian: "Kernel modules: nvidia-173, nvidia-current, nouveau, nvidiafb"
0,[04:45] <edbian> hylian: hi?
0,[04:45] <edbian> Guest7301: Is that a question?
0,[04:45] <hylian> edbian, i havent a clue.
0,[04:45] <mithran> in the minimal install, after i enter the proxy information, i get a blue and grey screen where i can type stuff(no terminal prompt though), but i cant do anything else
0,[04:46] <edbian> hylian: haha
0,[04:46] <mithran> i chose commandline install
0,[04:46] <Jeffsi> Griemak: ill try and burn another one then, brb
0,[04:46] <edbian> tbrew13: and... ?
1,[04:46] <sgaap> validnickname, btw, if unity still uses gnome-session you can also logout via the terminal with "gnome-session-save --kill"
0,[04:46] <hiexpo> hola   H8aors
0,[04:46] <Griemak> Jeffsi: WAIT!
0,[04:46] <Guest7301> edbian: hmmm, that's what i saw
0,[04:46] <sanferneda_> help
0,[04:46] <Jeffsi> Griemak: yea?
0,[04:46] <Griemak> Jeffsi: can you get to the menu screen and select "Check Disk for Errors"?
0,[04:46] <edbian> Guest7301: That seems fine.  You're using nvidia-173.  It's a proprietary driver.  I'm not clear what the issue is here
0,[04:46] <roasted_> hylian, I did?
0,[04:46] <edbian> roasted_: You did.
1,[04:46] <MrGizmo757> i am having Graphics Problems in 11.04.  COmpiz keeps lagging and crashing.   happens in Unity and in Gnome Classic.  running ati fglrx Driver. any ideas?
0,[04:47] <edbian> MrGizmo757: duh.  Try radeon
0,[04:47] <edbian> :P
0,[04:47] <roasted_> I didnt say anything in this channel until my name highlighted it..
0,[04:47] <sgaap> MrGizmo757, try the opensource driver
1,[04:47] <MNichie> There has to be a way to move the Unity global menu to a different screen.  Anybody know how?
0,[04:47] <rkvirani> Hi all
0,[04:47] <edbian> roasted_: You definitely said hi :)
0,[04:47] <sanferneda_> alguem sabe qual eo melhor linux
0,[04:47] <hylian> roasted_, <roasted_> hi (above)
0,[04:47] <Guest7301> edbian: it says that the driver is activated but not currently in use
0,[04:47] <Jeffsi> Griemak: i boot up then it says compaq then there is a black screen with the blinking curser
0,[04:47] <roasted_> oh
0,[04:47] <edbian> hylian: There is no way that could be fabricated
0,[04:47] <roasted_> wrong channel
0,[04:47] <Griemak> edbian: is the Nvidia module loaded as well as Nouveau?  That can cause issues with some things (GPU folding for example)
1,[04:47] <rkvirani> Anyone know how come unity cant handle dual monitors? when I plugin and enable my second monitor and stretch the screen unity slows to a crawl!
0,[04:47] <Guest7301> edbian: and my windows are messed up
0,[04:47] <roasted_> I meant to do that in another channel
0,[04:47] <edbian> Guest7301: The gui app is lying.
0,[04:47] <MrGizmo757> i couldnt get the open source driver to work with Catalyst.  i Need catalyst for My hdmi Displays
0,[04:48] <hylian> edbian, yeah, ha ha. i get it :P
0,[04:48] <edbian> Griemak: I have no idea!
0,[04:48] <tbrew13> edbian, terminal would not let me type had to log out
0,[04:48] <Guest7301> edbian: i can;t move or drag my windows
0,[04:48] <tbrew13> trying compiz now
0,[04:48] <sgaap> MrGizmo757, it could be that there is a double vsync running, that seemed to be an issue for a number of people
0,[04:48] <edbian> Guest7301: Try sudo apt-get purge nvidia-173 then restart. This will remove the nvidia-173 driver which will force the system to use nouveau.  See if that fixes it.
0,[04:48] <Griemak> Jeffsi: sound like the CD isn't bootable (bad burn) or your BIOS isn't set up to boot from the CD drive
0,[04:48] <cntrational> häagen-dazs
0,[04:48] <cntrational> is a funny word
0,[04:48] <hylian> tbrew13, terminal sometimes loses focus, and you have to click on it again to be able to type.
1,[04:48] <rkvirani> Any Ideas?
0,[04:48] <george_> Hey i installed crunchbang alongside Linux Mint and i cant hibernate
0,[04:49] <edbian> tbrew13: I was afraid of that.  What is the state of things right now?  Is compiz running?  Do you have window decorations?
0,[04:49] <george_> any advice?
1,[04:49] <rkvirani> my second monitor doesnt work with ubuntu, X can detect it and display to it but unity slows to a crawl
0,[04:49] <sgaap> Jeffsi, if it happens with another cd just try and older version of ubuntu server and dist upgrade it
0,[04:49] <gp5st> is there any way for me to increase my entropy pool (while generate gnupg keys) w/o a hardware device?
0,[04:49] <edbian> hylian: When replacing window managers things sometimes get stuck in a state of no window manager which is weird and you can't focus on anything.
1,[04:49] <rkvirani> I think its running compiz via software accell and not hardware accell how do I fix this????
0,[04:49] <dfcnvt> ...I gotta go. Good luck on your problem. (Google is your friend)
0,[04:49] <MrGizmo757> yeah i read somthing about turning off b-synch in compiz that works for some people. But it didnt seem to change anything for Me
0,[04:49] <tomasm-> is there a way I can revert my packages back to a state maybe 2 hours ago? i seem to ahve something installed that messed up my mouse in X (always stays on left side of screen)... i just want to undo all the packages, it may be a big list
0,[04:49] <Jeffsi> Griemak: i just through it in to my macbook and it says it a blank
0,[04:50] <hylian> edbian, ahh, yes. i have had that problem whilst messing with gnome 3.
0,[04:50] <sanferneda_> brasil
0,[04:50] <sgaap> MrGizmo757, and the vsync option in your ccc (catalyst control center)?
0,[04:50] <Griemak> Jeffsi: UGH!  Coaster for coffee :(
0,[04:50] <edbian> hylian: just do metacity --replace  and then ctrl + c
0,[04:50] <edbian> hylian: It'll switch to metacity, kill it, and you'll be left with no window manager but windows open.
0,[04:50] <hylian> edbian, good to know for next tim!
0,[04:50] <MrGizmo757> I only messed with Compiz settings.  i left CCC at its default settings
0,[04:50] <edbian> hylian: :D
0,[04:51] <Jeffsi> Griemak: i think these may be bad cds, should i maybe try a dvd?
0,[04:51] <edbian> hylian: You can switch to tty1 and do compiz --display :0.0  and it will come back !
0,[04:51] <edbian> hylian: :D
0,[04:51] <hylian> edbian, i couldn't afford the e in time.
0,[04:51] <sgaap> MrGizmo757, try if that does the trick, i had the same issues with the older driver (pre 114)
0,[04:51] <tbrew13> edbian, computer froze lost abilty to type in terminal and in xchat box could see you posting and the x part of windows went away
0,[04:51] <edbian> hylian: Made me think of Monty Python
0,[04:51] <Griemak> Jeffsi: can you try a burn at the slowest speed possible, maybe even 1x if possible?
0,[04:51] <tbrew13> this sucks dang it
0,[04:51] <tbrew13> what did i do im never upgrading again
0,[04:52] <edbian> tbrew13: Don't worry.
0,[04:52] <mithran> hi all, the place in the ubuntu installer where i have to enter in my proxy details, its says "http://[[user][:password]]@host[:port]/", i have no authentication, so how do i enter it, i tried http://[host][:port], but it dosent seem to work
0,[04:52] <edbian> tbrew13: What command caused the computer to freeze?  (did you see what I explained to hylian?  That's what happened to you)
0,[04:52] <Jeffsi> Griemak: that will take forever lol but yea ill try it, i burnt the last 1 in ubuntu desktop
0,[04:52] <tbrew13> ok i know its not the end of the world but now ubuntu boots up and i cant move windows unless i type metacity --replace
0,[04:53] <hylian> tbrew13, anyway you can type another command? nautilus --no-default-window
0,[04:53] <tbrew13> edbian compiz --replace
0,[04:53] <rmatte> Griemak: I just resolved the flash issue: add-apt-repository ppa:sevenmachines/flash && apt-get update && apt-get install flashplugin64-installer
0,[04:53] <Griemak> Jeffsi: double check your downloaded ISO, check the MD5 Sum and ensure it isn't a bad download as well.  I love my USB Stick because of this :)
0,[04:53] <tbrew13> hylian, okay
0,[04:53] <MagusOTB_> so other than the fact that it constantly runs my GPU fan at full blast, the default video driver seems to work quite a biut better than the ATI one. Is there a way to fix the fan thing?
0,[04:53] <hiexpo> hehe
0,[04:53] <validnickname> it worked :)
0,[04:53] <edbian> tbrew13: system -> preferences -> appearance -> desktop effects.  Turn them on.  This will launch compiz everytime for you
0,[04:54] <Jeffsi> Griemak:  do you know of any way to force a usb boot if its not suported, also i downloaded these via torrent so i think they should be good
0,[04:54] <sgaap> validnickname, logging out?
0,[04:54] <Griemak> rmatte: I tried the 64-bit flash, had issues with ONE website that I can't live without.... I dispise NSWrapper... 32 bit on 64 bit in 2011 is embarrasing
0,[04:54] <MagusOTB_> Apparently it does compositing too
0,[04:54] <tbrew13> edbian every time i launch compiz my  computer gets ruined
0,[04:54] <validnickname> sgaap: yes
0,[04:54] <hylian> edbian, i don't think he can get there... maybe if my nautilus desktop trick works...
0,[04:54] <MrGizmo757> ok Ill Give it a shot.
0,[04:54] <validnickname> sgaap: i logged in as classic now
0,[04:54] <tbrew13> i did your natilus no window thing
0,[04:54] <edbian> tbrew13: hylian I'm up for the nautilus trick
0,[04:54] <edbian> I'm guessing compiz-decorator is missing
0,[04:54] <mithran> In case my previous message was not visible - hi all, the place in the ubuntu installer where i have to enter in my proxy details, its says "http://[[user][:password]]@host[:port]/", i have no authentication, so how do i enter it, i tried http://[host][:port], but it dosent seem to work, am i entering it the wrong way?
0,[04:54] <MagusOTB_> also when did aptitude stop being a default-installed package?
0,[04:54] <Griemak> Jeffsi: yes, there is a way with a floppy or CD boot.  I don't have the info in front of me, a quick Google should find a nice tutorial on it.
1,[04:55] <validnickname> but how do i get the ne ubuntu thing back?
0,[04:55] <sgaap> validnickname, good
0,[04:55] <hylian> tbrew13 any changes? does alt f2 work, any windows? (any changes at all?)
0,[04:55] <Calif> with dhcpd, how do I declare a subnet that is for an external interface (not issueing addresses), that itself is using dhcp to get its address from upstream?
0,[04:55] <validnickname> sgaap *new
0,[04:55] <tbrew13> hylian, windows work because i typed metacity --replace in a terminal but if i make that terminal go away things usually disappear
0,[04:55] <edbian> tbrew13: Do you have a /usr/bin/compiz-decorator  ?
0,[04:56] <Guest83603> edbian: still no luck for my nvidia video
0,[04:56] <validnickname> but i realy want my old ubuntu again
0,[04:56] <edbian> Guest83603: what driver are you using now?  Same problem?
0,[04:56] <tomasm-> how do I get a list of packages recently installed from the command line?
1,[04:56] <validnickname> sgaap: how can i fix the thing now?
1,[04:56] <edbian> validnickname: Log out.  Click your name, change the session at the bottom, type your password and log in
0,[04:56] <hiexpo> add the nvidia repos
0,[04:56] <sgaap> validnickname, depends what needs fixing
0,[04:56] <Guest83603> edbian: Kernel modules: nvidia-current, nouveau, nvidiafb
1,[04:57] <validnickname> sgaap: i just want the bars back
1,[04:57] <validnickname> sgaap, the left bar
0,[04:57] <hylian> tbrew13,  this is totally not the way to solve this, but... one of my tricks is to add a startup app with that nautilus command, because i tore out empathy, gwibber, and evolution. and nwhen you do that, tada no desktop. maybe using the metacity comand in that way would work for you, but this is dirty pool to say the least.
0,[04:57] <edbian> Guest83603: What is listed as the driver?
0,[04:57] <Jeffsi> Griemak: im going to try a dvd quick, if anything ill get a more expensive coaster out of this
1,[04:57] <sgaap> validnickname, gnome 2 or unity?
0,[04:57] <hiexpo> edbian, wow
0,[04:58] <Griemak> Guest83603:  You have too many graphics driver modules!  nvidia-current and nvidia-173 are not compatible, so it's good you got rid of one.  What is your GPU?
0,[04:58] <edbian> hiexpo: wow?
0,[04:58] <Griemak> Jeffsi: that's a coaster for the scotch :)
0,[04:58] <hiexpo> edbian, bus y
0,[04:58] <edbian> hiexpo: haha, thanks
1,[04:58] <validnickname> ebian, when i do that wouldnt it be the same problem?
1,[04:58] <validnickname> i mean al the futures of 11.04 and my settings
0,[04:58] <edbian> tbrew13: I don't recommend doing what he did but you can try.  It is likely not to work.
0,[04:58] <edbian> tbrew13: Do you have a /usr/bin/compiz-decorator   ?
0,[04:58] <tbrew13> edbian, i cant move windows and i just logged in if i type metacity --replace i can move windows again but if i exit out of the terminal i lost the power to type in any boxes please help me either fix this or downgrade
1,[04:58] <validnickname> sgaap i mean all the futures of 11.04 and my settings
0,[04:58]  * hylian gives edbian an award for helpfullness.
0,[04:58] <MAbeeTT> hello, I found a kernel bug, where could I find info for "kernel bug reporting" ?
0,[04:59] <tbrew13> edbian, what is that
0,[04:59] <edbian> tbrew13: I know exactly what is happening.
0,[04:59] <MAbeeTT> I've picture of the dump
0,[04:59] <celthunder> MAbeeTT: kernel.org
1,[04:59] <sgaap> validnickname, im not sure what you mean by that, did the "problems" occur after upgrading to 11.04?
0,[04:59] <MAbeeTT> celthunder: directly to kernel.org?
0,[04:59] <tbrew13> edbian, okay shoot
0,[04:59] <edbian> tbrew13: When you boot there are no window managers running but there are windows open.  So you can't focus or anything
0,[04:59] <celthunder> MAbeeTT: if it's truly a kernel bug yes
1,[04:59] <validnickname> sgaap: no
0,[05:00] <tbrew13> yes i can see the x - and maximize buttons but cant move windows around
0,[05:00] <edbian> tbrew13: When you run metacity --replace& it puts on in.  When you do compiz, compiz runs but the window manager (compiz-decorator) is not running for some reason.  If you turn the effects off things will be back to normal because metacity will run by default
1,[05:00] <rkvirani> Anyone know how come unity cant handle dual monitors? when I plugin and enable my second monitor and stretch the screen unity slows to a crawl!
1,[05:00] <validnickname> sgaap: those problems came up cause of  compiz crash
0,[05:00] <edbian> tbrew13: We're trying to get compiz working correctly though right?
0,[05:00] <celthunder> MAbeeTT: why fix the bug for only one distro when if it's truly a kernel bug then it's probably in all distro's
1,[05:00] <rkvirani> How do I fix this?
1,[05:00] <sgaap> validnickname, in unity on 11.04 or something else?
0,[05:01] <rkvirani> I want to use two monitors, one my my laptop and th other external
0,[05:01] <tbrew13> edbian, yes like it did in 10.10
0,[05:01] <MAbeeTT> celthunder: well may the channel helpme for undestanding if it's a real kernel bug?
1,[05:01] <tbrew13> edbian, and then i want to uninstall unity
1,[05:01] <hylian> rkvirani, not that this is an answer, but unity is practically beta.... there is a better answer than mine, but I just thought you should know, unity is still pretty new and there are bugs,
0,[05:01] <edbian> tbrew13: So if you look at system -> preferences -> appaearences -> desktop effects what is it set to?
1,[05:01] <edbian> tbrew13: We'll get to unity
0,[05:01] <celthunder> rkvirani: xrandr
0,[05:01] <tbrew13> ok
0,[05:01] <MAbeeTT> celthunder: here there is a picture http://www.lugmen.org.ar/~mabeett/IMG_0444.JPG
0,[05:01] <ddamn> Heya, I have 10.10 installed and just tried installing bugzilla (after installing LAMP) via apt-get, where is the bugzilla html doc root though?? nothing in /var/www except for the default apache2 index.html
0,[05:01] <MAbeeTT> obviusly I can't copy/paste xD
1,[05:01] <validnickname> sgaap: yeah there was an errror with the unity and it is on 11.04
1,[05:02] <sgaap> validnickname, and the error?
0,[05:02] <edbian> hiexpo: Thanks :)  I was too busy to thank you before!
0,[05:02] <hylian> I am glad I am running 10.04.
0,[05:02] <edbian> hylian: I am glad I'm running Debian
0,[05:02] <edbian> :P
0,[05:02] <tbrew13> edbian, cant find that desktop effects
0,[05:02] <rkvirani> hylian: why would it be in ubuntu 11 then?
1,[05:02] <MagusOTB_> rkvirani: It's working fine on mine...
0,[05:02] <edbian> tbrew13: How far did you get?  Is desktop effects not a thing anymore?
0,[05:02] <MagusOTB_> (dual screens)
0,[05:02] <MAbeeTT> wow. IT'S a kernel bug "May  5 00:18:31 sobriux kernel: [33665.694041] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 00000000000000e0
0,[05:02] <celthunder> MAbeeTT: looking
1,[05:02] <rkvirani> MagusOTB_: when I try it draws garbage all over the screen and then everything slows to a crawl.
1,[05:02] <validnickname> sgaap: it said that there is an error with unity and that they should disable the plugin
0,[05:02] <MAbeeTT> "
0,[05:03] <tbrew13> edbian, im in appearnces background
0,[05:03] <tbrew13> edbian, there is no such thing as desktop prefrences
1,[05:03] <sgaap> the unity plugin?
0,[05:03] <hylian> rkvirani, well, gnome 2 is coming to it's end, and a lot of people don't like where gnome 3 is going. as to why they decided to release it at this stage, maybe to get us used to it? i really can't say,
0,[05:03] <celthunder> MAbeeTT: when did that show up
0,[05:03] <k|oWn> well my 11.04 loaded.  It took F(*&(king FIFTEEN MINUTES to load the live CD. this is why I thought it was freezing. what could possibly be causing it to lag insanely like this on 11.04, but on 10.10 it loaded to the liveCD really fast and when I installed 1010 its real fast. but with 11.04 livecd, its slow like a snail making me scared to install 11.04 on my HD.
0,[05:03] <eiriksvin> how do i install ubuntu when i had to manually use gparted and now the installer isnt showing /dev/sda3 (ext4) as an option
0,[05:03] <edbian> tbrew13: great.  Hang on I have to figure out where they put it now
0,[05:04] <edbian> tbrew13: It's late.  I have a final tomorrow.  Would you like to meet tomorrow?
1,[05:04] <sgaap> validnickname, you can also run ccsm and disable the plugin that it complains about so you can boot into unity again
0,[05:04] <MAbeeTT> celthunder: minutes ago. When in te meaning of scenario?
1,[05:04] <hylian> rkvirani, one thing you can try is to log out from unity, then log into classic mode (options on the bottom of the log in screen) and then see if it works better under gnome 2.
0,[05:04] <MagusOTB_> rkvirani: Set it to the settings you want, then reboot. It worked for me
0,[05:04] <luke_> can someone help me?
0,[05:04] <MAbeeTT> celthunder: cu -l ttyS0 -c 115200; #then ctrl-c
0,[05:04] <edbian> tbrew13: Sorry if this is frustrating!
0,[05:04] <MAbeeTT> celthunder: tail -f /dev/ttyS0
0,[05:04] <MagusOTB_> rkvirani: I think it has something to do with some internal X setting defaulting to 2560 pixels, and when you make a screen res larger than that, it gets confused
0,[05:04] <Dreamsforgotten> Anyone can lend a hand I deleted nvida package and can't start xwindows on ubuntu 10.04
1,[05:04] <sgaap> validnickname, this might happen if you enabled a compiz plugin that doesnt work together with the compiz plugin of unity
0,[05:04] <hylian> luke_, sure, what is the question.
0,[05:04] <rkvirani> MagusOTB_: I will try that first, hylan I wll try that second
0,[05:04] <luke_> i cant seem to find a way to upgrde ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04
0,[05:04] <eiriksvin> <luke_>ask ur question openly, if somone can they will
0,[05:04] <MagusOTB_> when I'm using the ATI driver, it won't let me go over 2560 at all
0,[05:05] <k|oWn> hylian: check it out i put update a minute ago on my situation
0,[05:05] <edbian> tbrew13: If you'd like to try one last ditch effort tonight.  Try compiz-decorator  at the terminal
0,[05:05] <Guest83603> edbian: Kernel modules: nvidia-current, nouveau, nvidiafb
0,[05:05] <celthunder> MAbeeTT: can you pm that to me so i can type it out
0,[05:05] <eiriksvin> luke_ go to system>administration>update manager
0,[05:05] <edbian> Guest83603: sudo apt-get purge nvidia-current  and restart
0,[05:05] <hylian> luke_, under system-> administration-> update manager, on the top, should be an option to do just that. if you like the console, tell me and i will give you the console command for apt-get to do it.
0,[05:06] <edbian> Guest83603: nvidia-current and nouveau are conflicting
1,[05:06] <sgaap> validnickname, if that is the case, run ccsm, enable (or disable and re-enable) the unity plugin in compiz and its likely you get a compiz warning where you can disable the blocking plugin
0,[05:06] <MAbeeTT> celthunder: ok
0,[05:06] <luke_> for some reason i cant find the update manager under my administration tab
0,[05:06] <hylian> k|oWn, i'm sorry i don't see it anywhere..
0,[05:06] <k|oWn> oh
0,[05:06] <MagusOTB_> But seriously, is it possible to get the default video driver to chill out with the GPU fan? This can't be healthy.
0,[05:07] <tbrew13> edbian, sure i live in louisiana so 2 my time gotta go
0,[05:07] <k|oWn> it worked with the livecd on 1104 but the problem was (is) that its taking like fifteen minutes to load. 10.10 is fast. what could be causeing this ?
0,[05:07] <edbian> tbrew13 cya
0,[05:07] <k|oWn> cuz now im afraid to install 11.04 fear of slowness
0,[05:07] <hylian> luke_, ok, then type control alt and t. then type sudo apt-get update. when this finishes, type sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.
1,[05:07] <sgaap> validnickname, if really nothing works and you dont know what error comes you can always remove compiz and reinstall it (sudo apt-get remove --purge compiz)
0,[05:07] <ddamn> Heya, I have 10.10 installed and just tried installing bugzilla (after installing LAMP) via apt-get, where is the bugzilla html doc root though?? nothing in /var/www except for the default apache2 index.html
0,[05:07] <Pokit> Is there a non-painful way of going from libre office back to open office?
0,[05:07] <MagusOTB_> also, whose idea was hiding the screen resolution app in (actually, I don't know where, the only way I knwo how to find it is to search for "monitors")
0,[05:08] <MagusOTB_> it was a really bad one.
0,[05:08] <eiriksvin> places>computer> click on file system to open that> then search it
0,[05:08] <k|oWn> ctrl alt t for a terminal i love it

0,[05:09] <hylian> k|oWn, to be honest I am not certain. i know that some people had problems with usb devices, and when they removed them during install it spead it up. other than that i cannot say, faulty cd, bad cd reader, hard drive damaged, or another hundred possibilities./
0,[05:09] <sgaap> eiriksvin, did you flag it as / ?
0,[05:09] <MagusOTB_> Dreamsforgotten: I think putting the driver on distribution media is against nvidia's TOS, but you could download the distfile and sneakerner it over
0,[05:09] <eiriksvin> flag it?
0,[05:09] <hylian> luke_, did you see my message? how are those commands coming?
0,[05:09] <eiriksvin> im opening gparted now
0,[05:10] <sgaap> eiriksvin, in gparted you can set a mount point
0,[05:10] <luke_> i typed in the first one now its not letting me type anything
0,[05:10] <Dreamsforgotten> MangusOTB_ can I do this command line? Can't get in xwindows
0,[05:11] <k|oWn> hylian ive got a hpwebcam and thats it for usb things. ill disconnect it. i doubt its the hd or the cddrive, cuz i just used them both for 10.10 a few days ago.  but the CD itself i suspect that might be screwey. but im more thinking its something hardware related. i look in the forums under known bugs and theres nothing absolutely nothing that is a joke i know theres known issues with natty like the USB one you just mentioned
0,[05:11] <Dreamsforgotten> Or can I fix it from booting the livecd?
0,[05:11] <Jeffsi> Griemak: technology just doesn't want to cooperate tonight, it may be a bit before i finally get this going
0,[05:12] <eiriksvin> ok my mount point says Mounted on /media/22b6d2aa-e749-4e9e-90a2-91f46f0bf641
0,[05:12] <IdleOne> hylian:  I apologize for the mistake
0,[05:12] <Dreamsforgotten> Don't want to loose my work I got 3 android builds synced
0,[05:12] <hylian> IdleOne, why did you kick me? thanks for the reply...
0,[05:12] <hylian> IdleOne, ohh, no problem, I make them too!
0,[05:12] <IdleOne> hylian: was a mistake on my part. sorry about that
0,[05:12] <sgaap> eiriksvin, then its mounted and there shouldnt be any problem
0,[05:13] <eiriksvin> i think its mounted from the cd
0,[05:13] <Griemak> Jeffsi: technology is supposed to make life easier... I'm on the fence, still :)
0,[05:13] <hylian> eiriksvin, you will have to flag that main parition as boot.
0,[05:13] <sgaap> eiriksvin, i am assuming this is from within the ubuntu installer?
1,[05:13] <mal10c> i'm running ubuntu 11.04, trying to keep chrome shortcut in launcher, and it dissapears when i drag it in, when it right click it to add, it disappears after a restart.  any thoughts?
0,[05:13]  * hylian pats IdleOne on the back :)
0,[05:13] <hylian> luke_, did that work for you>?
0,[05:13] <sgaap> eiriksvin, like hylian said, if you cant install on it its likely the mount point isnt set
0,[05:13] <Jeffsi> lol i know wat u mean :D
1,[05:14] <k|oWn> I thought this 11.04 was supposed to have unity, i see gnome here.
0,[05:14] <eiriksvin> but when i start the install i dont want it to wipe out windows but all it says is /dev/sda  but not /dev/sda3 where i want it
0,[05:14] <luke_> hylian, it not seeming to work...
0,[05:14] <sgaap> eiriksvin, where does it say that?
1,[05:14] <Griemak> k|oWn: Unity is a shell on top of Gnome 2
1,[05:14] <hylian> k|oWn, it does have unity. it's normally set as the default even
1,[05:14] <mal10c> chrome is the only app that does this too.  all other apps pin to the launcher
0,[05:14] <eiriksvin> im looking at gparted now from LIVE CD
0,[05:14] <hylian> luke_, did you try the apt-get commands i gave you?
0,[05:15] <ddamn> Heya, I have 10.10 installed and just tried installing bugzilla (after installing LAMP) via apt-get, where is the bugzilla html doc root though?? nothing in /var/www except for the default apache2 index.html
1,[05:15] <k|oWn> oh so unity runs on gnome i see.
0,[05:15] <luke_> hylian, i did i'm trying again tho
1,[05:15] <k|oWn>  how can i see what vertion of unity is running and check it out ?
0,[05:15] <Jeffsi> Griemak: ok things are looking a bit better, its about to verify the disk
0,[05:15] <sgaap> eiriksvin, then you should be able to see your partitions with gparted, so are you saying you dont see a partition where it should be? (which would be weird since its mounted)
0,[05:16] <hylian> luke_, if it gives you an error, or if terminal doesn't start with control alt T, let me know.
0,[05:16] <luke_> hylian, thanks for the help i got it :)
0,[05:17] <eiriksvin> no what im saying is all my partitions are correct, i dont know about flags, but when i run the installer it dont show any partitions and only allows my to install onto /dev/sda/
0,[05:17] <hylian> luke_, glad to hear it. if you need any other help we will be here.
0,[05:17] <luke_> hylian, you rock
0,[05:17] <eiriksvin> i need it to install onto /dev/sda3/
0,[05:17] <sgaap> eiriksvin, you can do a custom partitioning in the installer
0,[05:17]  * hylian blushes
0,[05:17] <eiriksvin> no, i cant it dont show it
0,[05:18] <sgaap> there you must be able to see that partition, give it a mount point and use it as install location
0,[05:18] <hylian> k|oWn, how goes it?
0,[05:18] <sgaap> eiriksvin, i just installed ubuntu 11.04 on a new pc and it was definitly there
0,[05:18] <eiriksvin> i am a noob, i dont know what to do
0,[05:19] <celthunder> eiriksvin: what're you trying to do?
0,[05:19] <Griemak> Jeffsi: Good luck!  Hope this disk does well.
0,[05:19] <eiriksvin> this is my 3rd pc done, but this one is the quad intel acpi
0,[05:19] <DuitseMusikant> Hi there, I ran some updates and now my menu bar is now in the middle of the screen, does anyone know what maybe have caused this?
0,[05:19] <celthunder> (too lazy to scroll up much farther than a page
0,[05:19] <hypodermia> my system hard freezes after a minute or so of playing audio through HDMI. any idea where is the best place to look for or file a bug? i'm not sure which component might be relevant.
1,[05:20] <scorch_> Why will .sh files not run from the Unity Desktop, nor shell for that matter?
0,[05:20] <eiriksvin> i want to know how to flag and set the mount so the installer will install ubuntu onto a certain partition
0,[05:20] <Jeffsi> Griemak: alright, now lets try this 1
0,[05:20] <hylian> eiriksvin, during install, there will be little round radio buttons, and one of them is usually install next to an existing operating system the other makes ubuntu take the whole hard drive, and the last let's you call the shots on where to put it, and allows you to make partitions, is this what you are looking for?
0,[05:20] <k|oWn> hylian im considering installing anyway but im afraid this slowness will be there even without bieng only on the live cd
0,[05:20] <sgaap> eiriksvin, it should work, however there was a bug just around the release where it didnt show partitions
0,[05:20] <faryshta> Does someone knows if hp 6735b comes with a built in microphone?
0,[05:20] <eiriksvin> hylian those bottuns did not show
0,[05:21] <Secluded1> which chat software can do facebook group chat?
0,[05:21] <sgaap> eiriksvin, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/769043 not sure if thats the same issue you are experiencing
0,[05:21] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 769043 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Cannot manually specify a mount point in the manual partitoner" [High,Fix committed]
0,[05:21] <k|oWn> haha but i want the java games at pogo to work in linux !!!!!   if it wasnt for this then everything else i and my family do would work and we would have no use for windows
0,[05:21] <eiriksvin> so what should the flag be?
1,[05:21] <scorch_> Why will .sh files not run from the Unity Desktop, nor shell for that matter?
1,[05:21] <hylian> k|oWn, well, being on the hard drive will speed it up. hmm. also there are some bugs in unity. did you remove all possible extras in the back, usb, etc?
0,[05:21] <k|oWn> i hate web developers that write for IE only they should be choked
0,[05:21] <Jeffsi> Griemak: how long would u say it should take for the blinking curser to go away?
0,[05:22] <hylian> eiriksvin, when you got to the stage where it asked where it should be installed, it's kind of hidden, but unless there is damage to that cd, it's always available... i don't know what else to say.
0,[05:22] <faryshta> Does someone knows if hp 6735b comes with a built in microphone?
0,[05:22] <eiriksvin> should the flag be boot, diag, hidden, lba, lvm, palo, prep, raid?
1,[05:22] <k|oWn> hylian i did not remove the usb cam yet im going to check it out in a few minutes.  is there a list somewhere of unity bugs. why would ubuntu put it into production if theres lots of bugs
1,[05:23] <scorch_> Why will .sh files not run from the Unity Desktop, nor shell for that matter?
0,[05:23] <sgaap> eiriksvin, thats not important, normally you can assign a mount point during install
0,[05:23] <sgaap> eiriksvin, like hylian says: its kinda hidden
0,[05:23] <eiriksvin> the cd is fine it worked twice before within the last week
1,[05:24] <Toph> i am running Unity and when I open an application, the panel containing the exit, minimize,maximize icon controls are missing
1,[05:24] <scorch_> Why will .sh files not run from the Unity Desktop, nor shell for that matter?
1,[05:24] <hylian> k|oWn, well, gnome 2 is going to be a thing of the past, and gnome 3 is not all that popular a replacement, so my opinion is they wanted to get the ubuntu population used to it, but don't quote me on this, it's just my opinion.
0,[05:24] <eiriksvin> can anyone tell me how to set the mount from here?
0,[05:24] <sgaap> eiriksvin, where those multiboots too?
0,[05:24] <eiriksvin> yes
0,[05:24] <k|oWn>                            interesting ill let you know if removing the USB things helps with my fifteen munite livecd booting.
0,[05:25] <eiriksvin> then, cus my personal pc was so nice i nuked win7
0,[05:25] <sgaap> eiriksvin, from the installer it should be possible if you manually partition
0,[05:25] <eiriksvin> this is my sisters
0,[05:25] <YEMX> I have a some questions regarding ubuntu
0,[05:25] <hylian> YEMX, ask your questions
1,[05:25] <scorch_> Why will .sh files not run from the Unity Desktop, nor shell for that matter?
0,[05:25] <YEMX> I dont use, but am seeing alot of it
0,[05:26] <Omega> YEMX: We'll tell you anything you want to know :)
0,[05:26] <Omega> Don't be afraid :)
0,[05:26] <YEMX> hate colors fried, using irssi
0,[05:26] <sgaap> scorch_, are they executable?
0,[05:26] <Omega> I'm using irssi myself too.
0,[05:26] <eiriksvin> so what should i set the mount point to?
0,[05:26] <haha> hello?
0,[05:26] <scorch_> sgaap: yes chmode 777 was done
0,[05:26] <haha> 有说汉语到吗
0,[05:26] <sgaap> eiriksvin, you should have a / on the partition where you want to install linux
0,[05:26] <sgaap> eiriksvin, and a partition for swap
0,[05:27] <YEMX> great proggy
0,[05:27] <MNichie> k| oWn: Ubuntu has clearly lost all respect for their users.  Apparently desktop users are now guinea pigs for touchscreen interfaces
0,[05:27] <Omega> haha: This is an english speaking channel
0,[05:27] <sgaap> scorch_, chmod +x?
0,[05:27] <haha> hahah
0,[05:27] <hylian> YEMX, your post sounded something like the amiga os would say when the kernel had an error :) can you be more, clear?
0,[05:27] <scorch_> sgaap: yes
0,[05:27] <red2kic> MNichie: That's why we have more than just one distro. Make a switch.
0,[05:27] <haha> my english is very poor
0,[05:27] <YEMX> PM for advanced?
0,[05:27] <YEMX> i dont use ubuntu
0,[05:27] <sgaap> scorch_, no idea then, works fine here, is it will all sh scripts?
0,[05:28] <YEMX> need info on the os
0,[05:28] <eiriksvin> i got a partition for swap
0,[05:28] <haha> bye everybody!
0,[05:28] <scorch_> sgapp:  I get thins in terminal:  exec: 121: ./nexuiz-linux-x86_64-sdl: Permission denied
0,[05:28] <hylian> haha, how can we help?
0,[05:28] <sgaap> eiriksvin, then you just need one for / as mountpoint
0,[05:28] <eckirchn> YEMX: what do you use?
0,[05:28] <sgaap> scorch_, thats another executable probably
0,[05:28] <YEMX> slack for the last 8+ yrs
0,[05:29] <scorch_> ???
0,[05:29] <scorch_> sgaap: ?????
0,[05:29] <YEMX> but i wanna know more bout ubunt
0,[05:29] <YEMX> slackware
0,[05:30] <Omega> YEMX: You can ask me anything you want :)
0,[05:30] <sgaap> scorch_, if its executable, and you got permissions it might need something external where you dont have persmissions on
0,[05:30] <scorch_> exec: 121: ./nexuiz-linux-x86_64-glx: Permission denied
0,[05:30] <YEMX> im using irssi and your color codes suck
0,[05:30] <sgaap> scorch_, and its very likely to be on rule 121
0,[05:31] <YEMX> hate to use kde to see :)
0,[05:31] <scorch_> why am I getting: exec: 121: ./nexuiz-linux-x86_64-glx: Permission denied
0,[05:31] <eiriksvin> how do i set the mount point?
0,[05:31] <eckirchn> YEMX never ran it... i run Fedora..
0,[05:31] <Omega> YEMX: what color codes? I don't see any.
0,[05:31] <celthunder> eiriksvin: mount <device> <mount point>
0,[05:31] <YEMX> brb
0,[05:31] <sgaap> eiriksvin, if the installer is working correct you should be able to set the mount point on partitions when using manual partitioning
0,[05:31] <eiriksvin> in the terminal?
0,[05:32] <red2kic> eiriksvin: "mkdir -p /media/Donkey"
0,[05:32] <YEMX> ill switch to xchat :(
0,[05:32] <eiriksvin> im not making a friggin directory named donkey:)
0,[05:32] <multipass|2> hi, does anyone know what it is in 11.04 that enables the iphone 4 to work?? for a few reasons im still using 10.10 but would like to bring the 11.04 iphone ability to it
0,[05:32] <eckirchn> YEMX i like Xchat...
0,[05:33] <sgaap> eiriksvin, those commands are for when you want to mount a volume, setting a mount point when partitioning is different
0,[05:33] <eckirchn> multipass|2 what ability do you want?
0,[05:33] <GarryFre> hey they got you second in the list of new releases at www.distrowatch.com front page
0,[05:33] <GarryFre> argh sorry wrong room
0,[05:33] <multipass|2> eckirchn: well, right out of the box everything about an iphone4 works in 11.04, copying songs, root directory access, even apps... ive tried the !iphone stuff but cant get it to work in 10.10
0,[05:33] <hylian> scorch_, looks like you ran the command from terminal, is this with sudo, like for instance, sudo nexuiz?
0,[05:33] <YEMX> back
0,[05:34] <eiriksvin> ok, i want to mount /dev/sda3/        with a mount point to install on how do i do that?
0,[05:34] <scorch_> hylian: yes
0,[05:34] <faryshta> Does someone knows if hp 6735b comes with a built in microphone?
0,[05:34] <eckirchn> multipass|2: you can't mount the iphone? when you say sync what app?
0,[05:34] <sgaap> eiriksvin, if you are in the installer you want to ""attach" the mountpoint / to that
0,[05:34] <OY1R> Q: what does Zeitgeist do ?
0,[05:35] <scorch_> hylian: also when I double click on desktop it does nothing
0,[05:35] <multipass|2> eckirchn: yeah, all i get is iphone pictures lol :|
0,[05:35] <atari314> Hey :) Anyone here with experience on debootstrap/multistrap? PST
0,[05:36] <eckirchn> OY1R   Zeitgeist is a data engine for the GNOME desktop. It logs and tags every document, website, conversation, email, note and application that’s opened on the GNOME desktop. All of the information is stored in one central database for quick access and any application can easily add it’s own data to the mix. There are several user interfaces which show the information stored in the database, sorting it by type, date, or relevance to
0,[05:36] <eckirchn> other files. They let users tag documents, bookmark them, and even attach custom notes to each item in the database. One of the interfaces, currently being developed by Siegried Gevatter as a Google Summer of Code project, even shows information from Zeitgeist inside the new GNOME Shell.
0,[05:36] <YEMX> I appreciate the support here for this OS
0,[05:36] <YEMX> need someone for cross platform
0,[05:36] <eckirchn> multipass|2 hmm.. what do you want to do you can't?
0,[05:36] <eiriksvin> listen, im not trying to refract the light from pluto and amplify and trasform it into a diamond... i told you i cant see anything in the installer for any drives at all it only allwas me to install on /dev/sda/   with no options at all
0,[05:37] <eiriksvin> allwas= allows
0,[05:37] <OY1R> eckirchn: what is it good for
0,[05:37] <eckirchn> eiriksvin why not install from a livecd?
0,[05:37] <eckirchn> OY1R: what is what good for?
0,[05:37] <OY1R> zeitgeist
0,[05:37] <sunil> I want to compile my own ubuntu media with some own applications. I am trying the link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization. In this link there is a command "debconf-get-selections --installer > somefile.txt" on executing this command I get the error "debconf: DbDriver "passwords" warning: could not open /var/cache/debconf/passwords.dat: Permission denied debconf: DbDriver "di_questions": could not open /var/log/inst
0,[05:37] <eiriksvin> OMG did you just join <eckirchn> eiriksvin why not install from a livecd?
0,[05:37] <eckirchn> OY1R: no idea.. don't use it
0,[05:38] <OY1R> so it's ok to get rid of
0,[05:38] <sgaap> eiriksvin, if there isnt anything to see there (and there should be), you can indeed try to use gparted from the livecd
0,[05:38] <eckirchn> eiriksvin yes i did
0,[05:38] <sgaap> eiriksvin, and then start the installer once the partitions are set
0,[05:39] <hylian> scorch_, from what i have read, there is one of two options, one is that you have the 64 bit version, and are running ubuntu 32 bit, the other is that instead of installing it in the usr/share directory, it installed elsewhere.
0,[05:39] <Neo_Kipl1ng> please tell me, when i update system, could i trust chinese server as source
0,[05:39] <hylian> scorch_, did you install nexuiz from synaptic or apt-get? or did you download it elsewhere?
0,[05:39] <sunil> on using sudo the first error is remove but "debconf: DbDriver "di_questions": could not open /var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat" error is still shown. anyone have any idea on this issue

1,[05:40] <daddy> is there a way to change 11.04 interface back to 10.10
1,[05:40] <DrFrankenstein> daddy: launching programs from a drop down menu instead of the screen with the icons?
1,[05:40] <Soupermanito> yes, log out and choose clasic interface at the log in menu
1,[05:40] <hylian> daddy, yes, log out, and then in the log in screen on the bottom, is an option for ubuntu classic mode. that will do it to it.
0,[05:40] <xxp> tttt
0,[05:40] <sgaap> eiriksvin, anyway, i need to catch some sleep now, keep in mind that bugs aside you should be able to set a partition with a mount point root from somewhere, be it the installer or via the livecd and gparted
0,[05:41] <YEMX> just trying to learn about the OS
0,[05:41] <daddy> hulian: thanks
0,[05:41] <sgaap> eiriksvin, http://askubuntu.com/questions/37809/when-manually-setting-up-hard-drives-in-the-installer-how-can-i-set-custom-mount
0,[05:41] <daddy> hylian: thanks
0,[05:41] <multipass|2> eckirchn: well.. everything lol, i want root access and access to music
0,[05:41] <eiriksvin> im on xchat on a live cd and im sitting here with gparted open showing all of my partitions i see the two labeled partitions i got a 5gb unallocated one (for restorations) and an ext4 (no label + flag=boot), plus my linux swap partition
0,[05:41] <hylian> daddy, no prob bob.
0,[05:42] <Captainkrtek> multipass|2, what do you need help with?
0,[05:42] <eckirchn> multipass|2: like i said in PM, not an iphone user, what program are you using to access music?  or just want to mount a drive? (or phone)..
0,[05:42] <hylian> eiriksvin, that sounds right.
0,[05:42] <YEMX> I need help
0,[05:42] <Captainkrtek> YEMX, what do you need help with
0,[05:42] <hylian> YEMX, ok how can we help?
0,[05:43] <YEMX> ubuntu commands
0,[05:43] <Captainkrtek> YEMX, what about them?
0,[05:43] <YEMX> can u PM me?
0,[05:43] <eiriksvin> ok, now how do i set the mount point and install into it
0,[05:43] <Captainkrtek> YEMX, sure
0,[05:43] <YEMX> thx
0,[05:43] <Captainkrtek> sent
0,[05:43] <eiriksvin> i already got grub up and running
0,[05:43] <hylian> eiriksvin, just so oyu know, during install, ubuntu will put grub whever it likes unless you go into the other install options at the hard drive screen and choose somehting else.
0,[05:44] <nikhil> n
0,[05:44] <hylian> eiriksvin, setting the mount point is done during install.
0,[05:44] <eiriksvin> im not worried about grub just the instal
0,[05:44] <sgaap> eiriksvin, if you are in irc via de livecd, you should try the installer, there should be an option for manual install where you can set the mountpoint
0,[05:44] <nikhil> hi
0,[05:44] <lordofthenoobs_> I have ubuntu 11.4 on a pavilion dv6345us laptop and i cannot figure out how to get ubuntu to recognise the camera the laptop has built into it above the screen
0,[05:45] <lordofthenoobs_> any kind of help would be great
0,[05:45] <k|oWn> man, the other day i did a fresh clean install of 10.10 and let it do the upgrade to 11.04 and it TOOK THREE HOURS AND THEN KILLED MY WHOLE SETUP
0,[05:45] <lordofthenoobs_> ive check online for a solution but no luck
0,[05:45] <eiriksvin> there are no options i have looked, the only option it gives me is to install onto /dev/sda/ but there is no /sda/ i have sda1 sda2 sda3 sda4 and unallocated
0,[05:45] <multipass|2> eckirchn: yeah, in 11.04 now out of the blue, it mouts 2 drives on my iphone, and along with that, all msuic apps..rythembox..etc recognize the music. i cant figure out what allows for that in new ubuntu version
0,[05:46] <k|oWn> had no loader, no nothing working at all 11.04 is a bit premature i think
0,[05:46] <Hendrik1> ahh i lost access to my server theres an fatal error on boot ... server is in germany ... i#m in the usa for another 6 month ... damn
0,[05:46] <eiriksvin> sgaap the live cd is not the beat all end all, it works most of the time i agree but its not working now
0,[05:46] <magus_> I'm trying to install a .pcf.Z font, and the font manager displays it, installs is, and it does not show up in the menu for gnome-term when I go to profiule preferences
0,[05:46] <Fahmida> Hi, I have a problem with Ubuntu 11.04. Suddenly, the sound gone, though sound is working in Windows.
0,[05:46] <lordofthenoobs_> is there anyone here who can assist me? i thought this was help chat
0,[05:46] <hylian> eiriksvin, if you look at this picture: http://www.n00bsonubuntu.net/wp-content/uploads/ubuntu_10.10_a3_vb_install_screen_3.png you will see below in the grayed out area, the option to "Specify partiitions manually (advanced)" you have to choose that to set it up specially.
0,[05:47] <daddy> hylian: i dont have this option????
0,[05:47] <eckirchn> multipass|2 does then new version not mount your drives?
0,[05:47] <MagusOTB_> Fahmida: Wait, that's not normal behaviour when using Pulseaudio?
0,[05:47] <eiriksvin> let me repeat, it never shows that
0,[05:47] <atari314> Anyone trying absolute minimal installs?
0,[05:47] <k|oWn> hendrick1: omfg that sucks what is the error what caused it
0,[05:47] <hylian> daddy, it didn't give you the option to log out, or the option to choose ubuntu classic in the log in screen on the bottom?
0,[05:47] <Fahmida> MagusOTB_: what is Plusaudio?
0,[05:48] <clipper> would a live cd of 11.04 popping up constant report problem dialogs be indicative of a bad iso, or incompatible hardware?
0,[05:48] <lordofthenoobs_> I have ubuntu 11.4 on a pavilion dv6345us laptop and i cannot figure out how to get ubuntu to recognise the camera the laptop has built into it above the screen, can anyone point me in the right direction?
0,[05:48] <MagusOTB_> Fahmida: The audio subsystem that Ubuntu uses.
0,[05:48] <daddy> hylian: sorry ,found the option.very silly of me
0,[05:48] <MagusOTB_> Fahmida: All I can say is good luck, I've had no good experiences with linux sound.
0,[05:48] <BigPalabra> Hi, I have a doubt ...
0,[05:48] <Hendrik1> k|oWn: i was just preparing to install wordpress then i notice the ssh didnt react any more and i couldn#t access my other blog
0,[05:48] <Fahmida> MagusOTB_: Okay thanks.
0,[05:48] <hylian> eiriksvin, it's hard to see, and it has always showed it to me. You probably are right, but can you take it that far just to see if it's there again? you may have to scroll down to get this option..
0,[05:48] <Fahmida> Does anyone can help please?
0,[05:48] <MagusOTB_> Fahmida: Although it might be worth running alsamixer and unmuting channels.
0,[05:49] <Fahmida> MagusOTB_: How to do that?
0,[05:49] <hylian> daddy, no problem.
0,[05:49] <BigPalabra> help plz
0,[05:49] <syrinx_> BigPalabra: ?
0,[05:49] <Hendrik1> i guess i#m screwed
0,[05:49] <MagusOTB_> Fahmida: open up a terminal, run alsamixer
0,[05:49] <hylian> please dont ask for help, please just ask your question, thank you! :)
0,[05:49] <FishFace> lordofthenoobs_: What programs have you tried using? Cheese perhaps?
0,[05:49] <clipper> would a live cd of 11.04 popping up constant report problem dialogs be indicative of a bad iso, or incompatible hardware?
0,[05:49] <MagusOTB_> if "master" or "PCM" are mutes, unmute them
0,[05:50] <syrinx_> hylian: !please
0,[05:50] <MagusOTB_> (change levels with up and down arrows, mute/un with 'm')
0,[05:50] <Braiam> !help | BigPalabra
0,[05:50] <ubottu> BigPalabra: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
0,[05:50] <hylian> syrinx_, thanks!
0,[05:50] <syrinx_> thats the one ;)
0,[05:50] <Fahmida> MagusOTB_: It says, command does not found.
0,[05:50] <daddy> just upraded to 11.04 and my network is gone?
0,[05:50] <lordofthenoobs_> ive been looking on the ubuntu site for answers and didnt find anything, so no i havent tried cheese
0,[05:50] <bp0> is there a way to disable the "New Ubuntu release available" message in update manager?
0,[05:50] <k|oWn> hendrick do u have friends there
0,[05:50] <hylian> syrinx_, do you use inx?
0,[05:50] <Fahmida> MagusOTB_: Found it. :)
0,[05:50] <FishFace> lordofthenoobs_: Cheese is your best bet, or at least the easiest. It usually find everything.
0,[05:50] <syrinx_> hylian: inx?
0,[05:51] <syrinx_> !inx
0,[05:51] <Fahmida> MagusOTB_: What to do now?
0,[05:51] <syrinx_> nope.
0,[05:51] <lordofthenoobs_> ok ty fish face ill try that and if it dont work ill be back
0,[05:51] <hylian> syrinx_, yes, inx is a off shoot of ubuntu, without x. (is not x)
0,[05:51] <FishFace> lordofthenoobs_: OK. But other than that I don't know what else to say.
0,[05:51] <syrinx_> hylian: oh, no, I don't use Ubuntu anymore ;) I just help those that do
0,[05:51] <Hendrik1> k|oWn: xes but noone with sufficiant linux knowledge to retrive the data from my software raid 10 with encryption and reinstalling it
0,[05:51] <MagusOTB_> Fahmida: Are master, PCM, and front unmutes?
0,[05:52] <clipper> would a live cd of 11.04 popping up constant report problem dialogs be indicative of a bad iso, or incompatible hardware?
0,[05:52] <k|oWn> hendrik wow what if they popped in a live cd and you remoteaccessed that
0,[05:52] <Neo_Kipl1ng> I used chinese server source to update to 11.04, it's faster, but now i little scared, is this secure?
0,[05:52] <trism> bp0: Ubuntu Software Center/Edit/Software Sources/Updates/Show new distribution releases/Never
0,[05:52] <hylian> eiriksvin, i'm sorry you have had so many troubles. maybe if we started at the beginning, maybe i missed something?
0,[05:52] <eiriksvin> it asks me device for boot loader installation /dev/sda/ but that would wipe my whole hdd? wouldnt it?
0,[05:53] <k|oWn> hahaha ive never been in this room before. some of these questions have GOT to be trolls
0,[05:53] <Fahmida> MagusOTB_: How to find it's mute or not? Written MM?
0,[05:53] <Hendrik1> k|oWn: hmm you might have a point, didn't think about that yet
0,[05:53] <hylian> eiriksvin, no, the boot loader won't touch that partition, except to house the boot loader there. that will not destroy your other os.
0,[05:53] <bp0> trism, thanks
0,[05:53] <ubuntu_my> hey guys, is there any way to upgrade my ubuntu without losing anything??
0,[05:54] <atari314> anyone had tried debootstrap or multistrap restrict packages installed?
0,[05:54] <eiriksvin> ok, so if i click install and installs to that, will it be ok?
0,[05:54] <hanasaki> is ubuntu going to get rid of gnome completely?  when will there be gnome 3 support?
0,[05:54] <ferris-> just upgraded to natty but now I have no desktop... can someone help me get this back
0,[05:54] <Hendrik1> k|oWn: iactually just came here to cry about it but now i at least have an idea thx man
0,[05:54] <Neo_Kipl1ng> Could i trust chinese server as software source? anyway, it's in offical list.
0,[05:54] <hylian> ubuntu_my, yes. sudo apt-get update, and then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade should do it. hopefully you have fast internet, because it can take a while.
0,[05:55] <hylian> ubuntu_my, let me add that those commands are entered from the terminal, found in applications -> accessories.
0,[05:55] <eiriksvin> ok, so if i click install and installs to that, will it be ok?
0,[05:55] <MagusOTB_> Fahmida: If it says MM and has no bar, it's mutes
0,[05:55] <ubuntu_my> hylian, yes. but sadly i havent. i already download the alternate iso for 11.04, but it will remove some (important) app
0,[05:56] <MagusOTB_> Fahmida: if it says "00" it's not muted, but is turned down and should be turned up
0,[05:56] <k|oWn> hendrick: hey youre welcome man i havnt had a chance to help someone in so long :)
0,[05:56] <hylian> eiriksvin, yes. it only will use the boot sector area on the hard drive, the partition itself will be unaffected. and it will then let you boot to windows when grub fires up.
0,[05:56] <k|oWn> im here for my own help, for some reason 11.04 live cd is really slow on my box but 10.10 is fast and now thats making me scared to install 11.03
0,[05:56] <k|oWn> 4
0,[05:57] <Fahmida> MagusOTB_: It says MM but has bars.
0,[05:57] <hylian> ubuntu_my, ok, what you can do is add the cd as the basis for updating, by going to synaptic, and from there adding it as a source.under settings and repositories in synaptic
0,[05:58] <Hendrik1> hmm its running pretty smoth here though it feels like the windows vista of ubuntu#s
0,[05:58] <MagusOTB_> Fahmida: Press 'm' to unmute them.
0,[05:58] <MagusOTB_> (also navigate right and left to select which ones)
0,[05:58] <Guest28670> edbian: how to remove those drivers and install the right one
0,[05:58] <Guest28670> how to remove nvidia drivers and install the right one
0,[05:59] <Fahmida> MagusOTB_: Now?
0,[05:59] <Fahmida> Afte that.
0,[05:59] <daddy> network unclaimed.how do i claim it?
0,[05:59] <ferris-> just upgraded to natty but now I have no desktop... can someone help me get this back
0,[06:00] <ferris-> already installed all of natty... just do not have the desktop
0,[06:00] <hylian> Guest28670, upon booting ubuntu, at the very start, you can hit the escape key, this will give you a grub menu. you can then choose the 2nd option, and then from there, tell ubuntu to start x in safe graphics mode. then in system-administration-hardware drivers, you can safely remove the driver.
0,[06:00] <Fahmida> MagusOTB_: No sound yet. Is there anything need to do?
0,[06:00] <ferris-> had it but lost it after upgrading

0,[06:08] <rkhshm> whiel trying to do a nfs mount from ubuntu i get an error stating " mount system call failed"
0,[06:08] <daddy> is there a fall back to 10.10?

0,[06:08] <rkhshm> what is wrong>?
0,[06:08] <cyrano_> I've recently installed natty and i have a triple monitor setup with two video cards and im using xinerama which seems to be breaking the window manager which I think is cause compositing is trying to run. my question is how do I disable it in natty it was a simple setting change in 10.04 just using gconf-editor but that setting doesn't seem to change anything anymore
0,[06:10] <cyrano_> sorry if that wasn't clear the question was how do I disable compositing
1,[06:10] <coz_> cyrano_,  if you want compiz off you may have to either install unity2d  from the repository or log off and log onto classic
1,[06:11] <coz_> cyrano_,   unity 2d does not use compiz  and of course classic gnome ( no effects)  will not either however  compiz in classic is fine
0,[06:11] <cyrano_> well I am using classic as well but compositing still seems to be set as I see the fancy minimizing of windows and advanced shadows when using one monitor
0,[06:11] <coz_> cyrano_,  ok if you are in classic  hit alt+F2  type   metacity --replace
0,[06:12] <coz_> cyrano_,  that will kill compiz  or just log of and log onto  classic gnome (no effects)
1,[06:12] <giacomo_c> i have to say, this retarded new design crap with 11.04 has only made me use the terminal more, how do i get rid of this dumb sidebar and put a regular menu at the top?
0,[06:13] <cyrano_> alt+f2 doesn't seem to work the only way I was able to run any commmands was through making a shortcut on the desktop
0,[06:13] <coz_> cyrano_,   now I only have dual monitors and have never tried it with more than that
0,[06:13] <coz_> cyrano_,  ok open a terminal   metacity --replace & disown
1,[06:13] <coz_> cyrano_,  is there a big launcher bar on the left side of the monitor with icons?
0,[06:14] <cyrano_> ha no only gedit is open and the desktop no taskbars at all
0,[06:14] <cyrano_> well and I have xterm open
0,[06:14] <coz_> cyrano_,  ok
0,[06:15] <cyrano_> that did bring back the WM thoguh
0,[06:15] <rkhshm> any ideas guys?
0,[06:15] <cyrano_> but no taskbars
0,[06:15] <coz_> cyrano_,  no gnome panels you mean?
0,[06:15] <cyrano_> correct
0,[06:15] <coz_> cyrano_,  ok please log off,, choose the session with  ( no effects)
0,[06:16] <Captainkrtek>  rkhshm what is the issue?
0,[06:16] <coz_> cyrano_,  start there and see what you can do with xinerama
0,[06:16] <Guest30793> how to remove nvidea drivers and install the right one
0,[06:16] <cyrano_> ha well I set it to auto login when I installed ubuntu
0,[06:16] <coz_> cyrano_,  if at that point you want to start compiz to try it in that setup   open a terminal  compiz --replace ccp & diwown
0,[06:16] <cyrano_> and without gnome panels not sure how to log out
0,[06:17] <coz_> cyrano_,  ok  in terminal     gnome-panel & disown
0,[06:17] <cyrano_> oh no I don't care for compiz at all
0,[06:17] <cyrano_> oh sweet they are back thanks
0,[06:18] <coz_> cyrano_,  ok now unset autolog in or log off and choose the ( no effects ) session then you wont have to go through this each time
0,[06:18] <rkhshm> Captainkrtek: I'm trying to nfs mount ubuntu client but i get a system call error
0,[06:18] <Guest30793> how to remove nvidea drivers and install the right one

0,[06:22] <coz_> Guest30793,   can you explain  "auto" for installing nvidia drivers?
0,[06:22] <coz_> Guest30793,  did you go into system/administration/ additional drivers to do t his ?

0,[06:23] <cyrano_> @coz- Thanks you very very much for your swift reply and very helpful advice
0,[06:23] <coz_> cyrano_,  no problem
0,[06:23] <cyrano_> idk why I never thought to use classic with no effects
0,[06:23] <cyrano_> just seems so simple now that I think about it HAHAHA
0,[06:23] <coz_> cyrano_,  yeah however I do believe that will NOT be available in the future
0,[06:23] <Guest30793> coz_: no, it says in my additional driver "the driver is activated and currently not in use"
0,[06:24] <cyrano_> ouch
0,[06:24] <coz_> Guest30793,   did you reboot after installing the driver?
0,[06:24] <cyrano_> ie 11.10?
0,[06:25] <cyrano_> I feel like they are going backwards with ubuntu xinerama has been deprecated for years and they took out support for compositing a long time ago
0,[06:25] <coz_> Guest30793,  if you did NOT reboot ...do that now..however if you did  ,, in that same driver dialog,, click the one installed,, and click the remove button
0,[06:25] <cyrano_> is linux not supposed to be a multi display setup?
0,[06:25] <cyrano_> haha
0,[06:25] <coz_> cyrano_,  off hand I cant give the reasons for that actually,, but it was a sort of sensible one,, I believe
0,[06:26] <coz_> cyrano_,   well if linux is headed that way its back to windows for me :)
0,[06:26] <coz_> I cannot deal with single monitors
1,[06:26] <rkvirani> silly unity
1,[06:26] <rkvirani> dual monitors are for real power users.
1,[06:26] <Captainkrtek> rkvirani, totally agree lol
0,[06:26] <cyrano_> oh this is wonderful triple monitors again in ubu
1,[06:27] <Captainkrtek> Im using gnome because of unity hates my monitors
0,[06:27] <coz_> cyrano_,  i did see a set up last year with 6 monitors,, xinerama  + compiz    amazing :)
0,[06:27] <Captainkrtek> cyrano_, what video card do you have?
0,[06:28] <cyrano_> yea but you have to hack xinerama to get compositing these days
0,[06:28] <cyrano_> I have two nvidias

0,[07:08] <Dreamsforgotten> Dawnlight if I can if not turn on wireless command line either one if I get net back I can sudo apt get network manager
0,[07:08] <bl4d3> Bonjour à tous
0,[07:08] <Rehan> syrinx_: what if i dont want to use the nvidia proprietary drivers? I know the liveCD doesn't use them. It just uses open source drivers. I'd like to use the same.

0,[07:09] <bl4d3> sorry
0,[07:10] <syrinx_> the liveCD uses the driver yes, because xf86 drivers are opensource
0,[07:10] <jcmarini> Flynn which version are you using... Ubuntu
0,[07:10] <Fuchs> bl4d3: you can /join the ubuntu channel in your language, e.g. /join #ubuntu-fr for french
0,[07:10] <Rehan> syrinx_: i'm confused. does the liveCD use the nvidia proprietary drivers?
0,[07:10] <Rehan> syrinx_: can I PM you?

0,[07:13] <josuf107> ah I think that's right dreamsforgotten

0,[07:13] <Flynn> jcmarini ;  Jpegs? nothing loads it just quits unexpectedly immediately
0,[07:14] <gnewb> Shayd: Yes and no, that is it depends on the Mobo, and other hardware interface settings.
0,[07:15] <Dreamsforgotten> Josuf107 I just bypassed my xorg.conf changed nvidia to nv just to load xwindows gotta get net back to get nvdia back
0,[07:16] <josuf107> are you having trouble connecting to the internet?

0,[07:35] <jiltdil> Dawnlight:thanks
0,[07:35] <Ymer-work-> novitololo, ah, i do apologize, I misunderstood the question. Well which on of the hwaddresses you should use, really depends on what ip you have on the different NICs.
0,[07:36] <novitololo> Ymer-work-: what do you mean?
0,[07:36] <novitololo> eth0 says UP BROADCAST MULTICAST, while eth1 says inet6 addr..
0,[07:37] <novitololo> well I mean in eth0 it doesn't say inet6 addr
0,[07:37] <DawnLight> Nabi: i noticed that in 11.04. i guessed that it was because my card didn't support compiz "so why bother?"
0,[07:38] <johnathan> im trying to play a dvd and movie player keeps saying "Could not read DVD. This may be because the DVD is encrypted and a DVD decryption library is not installed."
0,[07:38] <DawnLight> novitololo: then it is probably eth0 because UP means that it is enabled

0,[07:40] <Ymer-work-> novitololo, do you have an ip-address on both card or just one?
0,[07:40] <novitololo> just on eth1 says inet6 addr
0,[07:40] <DawnLight> novitololo: if you have wifi then probably one is wifi and the other is wwired
0,[07:40] <Ymer-work-> okey, then i'd recommend that you use the MAC on eth0

0,[08:04] <josuf107> @flynn, if you're not sure about this
0,[08:05] <ondrejk> hello, after upgrading to new version my nm-applet and volume control applet disappeared, tray is not missing and nm-applet --sm-disabled exists in autostart applications, when i run nm-applet manually into console, nm-applet icon will show up
0,[08:05] <gnewb> Flynn: Many KDE programs run well in Gnome, Flux, OB, or many others I have forgotten to name, that like ubottu showed is a good one.
0,[08:05] <josuf107> flynn you should be aware that doing sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop will install a large number of packages
0,[08:05] <Blue1> ondrejk: ru running gnome?
0,[08:05] <ondrejk> Blue1: yup
0,[08:05] <josuf107> but sudo apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop will not remove all of them
0,[08:06] <josuf107> at least, not the last time I did this
0,[08:06] <tx0105> Bluel - The biggest issue is that I think Intel graphics driver is shot...it's defaulting me in a 1024x768 resolution despite having a widescreen monitor (my screen has black bars on each side)....if i try to increase the resolution in the monitor config, ubuntu acts up (kubuntu 11.04 went crazy and crashed)
0,[08:06] <Flynn> Ok that didn't work:  Package kde is not available, but is referred to by another package.
0,[08:06] <Flynn> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or

0,[08:06] <DawnLight> ok. that worked
0,[08:07] <Blue1> ondrejk: okay right click on an used portion of the task bar, left click on add to panel, then left click on indicator applet
0,[08:07] <josuf107> nice work dawnlight
0,[08:07] <gnewb> Flynn: Yes, what josuf107 stated is very true, is either go full KDE or just use sme of the neato prgrams from the KDE team, I like K3B, but some of the stuff is a matter of personal preferences.
0,[08:07] <faryshta> Can someone help me with my microphone?
0,[08:07] <Blue1> ondrejk: note this works in 10.10 dunno about 11.04
0,[08:08] <Blue1> !sound | faryshta
0,[08:08] <ubottu> faryshta: If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
0,[08:08] <Flynn> gnewb: Ok well how do I go full KDE?  In GUI
0,[08:08] <dreamsforgotten> Dawnlight thanks anyway for your time
0,[08:08] <ondrejk> Blue1: it does not work for network manager applet
0,[08:08] <josuf107> flynn: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
0,[08:08] <gnewb> !KDE | Flynn
0,[08:08] <ubottu> Flynn: KDE (http://kde.org) is the !desktop environment used natively in !Kubuntu. To install from Ubuntu: « sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop », or see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE . See http://kubuntu.org for more information.
0,[08:08] <dreamsforgotten> Dawnlight I do appreciate it!
0,[08:08] <josuf107> i do believe
0,[08:08] <Flynn> Is KDE less "buggy"
0,[08:09] <Blue1> ondrejk: oops I though you said volume control
0,[08:09] <josuf107> xmonad is less buggy
0,[08:09] <faryshta> Blue1, not the same issue.
0,[08:09] <josuf107> flynn disregard former comment about xmonad
0,[08:10] <ondrejk> Blue1: volume control does not work also, but this is not as problematic as missing network manager plugin
0,[08:10] <DDAZZA> Hello, I've recently tried to upgrade to 11.4 however my computer won't boot any more and gives this error: http://pastebin.com/aZHg9q6M How can I resolve this?
0,[08:10] <Blue1> ondrejk: let me schlep for a sec
0,[08:11] <ondrejk> Blue1: i dont understand it, command which should start nm-applet is already present in autostart applications but it wont start after login, each time i log gin i need to type nm-applet into terminal
0,[08:11] <ondrejk> Blue1: ok
0,[08:11] <Blue1> ondrejk: you do have a notification area, right?
0,[08:11] <ondrejk> Blue1: yes i do
0,[08:11] <tx0105> blue1 - any advice on the video resolution issue?
0,[08:12] <Flynn> josuf107:  OK but, whayt do you think of KDE?
0,[08:13] <Flynn> All this because I wanted a simple animated wallpaper.
0,[08:13] <Blue1> ondrejk: worth a shot:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=423543
0,[08:13] <josuf107> flynn: KDE is great. lots of people I know and admire do amazing work on it
0,[08:14] <Flynn> K I'll try it.
0,[08:14] <Blue1> ondrejk: see # 4
0,[08:14] <ondrejk> Blue1: will check it
0,[08:14] <BigPalabra> hey .. It's there some kind of bug in Ubuntu 11.04 when you activate compiz ???
0,[08:14] <paranoidphreak> hi everybody, is there anyway to share cpu load over the network?
0,[08:14] <josuf107> flynn: you should know though that I don't use it myself. I have used it, and it's very attractive and useable, but I prefer something a little lighter
0,[08:14] <Blue1> ondrejk: best I could find -- not tried it personally
0,[08:14] <ondrejk> Blue1: this is not my problem, i can start nm-applet manually .. but it wont start automatically after logging in
0,[08:15] <Blue1> ondrejk: and this tells you how to fix that.

0,[08:21] <giacomo_c> DawnLight, i have no idea what i did, but i fixed it... like a linux pro
0,[08:22] <josuf107> flynn: use kdm for the immersive kde experience
0,[08:22] <red2kic> Flynn: If you're using GNOME, gdm. If you're using KDE, kdm.
0,[08:22] <Flynn> OK that's what I thought
0,[08:22] <gaurav_help> my sticky notes removed automatically how i recover that contains lot of  things and much important

0,[08:24] <josuf107> flynn: you're getting a lot of new software
0,[08:24] <josuf107> mr0: you need to chmod u+x file.exe
0,[08:24] <Blue1> mr0: have you checked the wine site?  ah permission error is something entirely different
0,[08:24] <josuf107> or right-click

0,[08:24] <josuf107> **as a program
0,[08:25] <Flynn> josuf107: Its still downloading crap.  I wish it had a general progress bar.
0,[08:25] <mr0> hmm, I'm pretty noob at ubuntu and linux in general. Is there a walkthrough for chmod u+x file.exe?
0,[08:26] <mr0> okay I'll try that
0,[08:26] <josuf107> flynn: you're getting a lot of new programs and utilities. A desktop environment comes with all kinds of trappings and gizmos which you will find very useful later
0,[08:26] <Flynn> KO
0,[08:26] <josuf107> flynn: think of it as a desktop experience instead
0,[08:27] <Flynn> Sounds cool.
0,[08:27] <mithran> andyland: download .deb abd dpkg -G
0,[08:27] <Flynn> Open  source confuses me.

0,[08:28] <mithran> abd --> and
0,[08:28] <Blue1> Flynn: what specifically?
0,[08:28] <andyland> mithran: thanks will try it now
0,[08:29] <Blue1> Flynn: the great thing about open source, is you are your own system administrator.  the worst thing about open source is, you are your own system adminstrator.
0,[08:29] <Flynn> Blue1:  If x amount of people want to download something, who "foots" the bill as far as space on a server somewhere?
0,[08:29] <Blue1> Flynn: commercial users
0,[08:30] <gaurav_help> how i recover my windows buttons in ubuntu 11.04 my system is freaking me out
0,[08:30] <Flynn> eventually the buck will get passed to us.

0,[08:31] <jcmarini> Flynn: if you get animated wallpaper i would be very interested- but i wouldn't try it
0,[08:31] <Blue1> Flynn: I have been using linux for 6 years, no body has charged me yet.
0,[08:31] <Flynn> TV used to be free too. Remember?
0,[08:31] <Blue1> Flynn: i pay my cable company for net access is all.

0,[08:40] <mikunos> Niente da fare

0,[08:41] <mikunos> Hi guys
0,[08:41] <mikunos> my audio card dosn't work anymore
0,[08:41] <mikunos> *doesn't
0,[08:41] <k|oWn> josuf107: when i had 10.10 and the updater asked me if i want to goto 11.04 i did it. it took a couple hours of downloading and installing, then it completely hosed my grub and my linux install. i even couldnt access the windows side of my dualboot.
0,[08:42] <josuf107> kjown: sounds promising
0,[08:42] <k|oWn> now ive installed a fresh copy of 11.04 and it got my grub back and my windows(barf) loads ok now. but the ubuntu 11.04 doesnt have java just "working" like before
0,[08:42] <Blue1> k|oWn: well I know a fix for grub, but ymmv applies -- I never update, I do a fresh install
0,[08:42] <k|oWn> i could have hacked the grub to work i know
0,[08:43] <k|oWn> but with a powerful amount of problems the update is useless
0,[08:43] <k|oWn> so, like always with crappywindows, a fresh instal lis better
0,[08:43] <k|oWn> but what about java why isnt it just included like on 1010
0,[08:43] <k|oWn> now have to manually download it
0,[08:43] <andyland> mithran: Just downloaded the deb file via wget, name of the file is: sphinxsearch_0.9.9-6_i386.deb what was the dpkg install command again?
0,[08:43] <Blue1> k|oWn: i backup /etc/ and /home/ and then do a fresh install.
0,[08:44] <k|oWn> and newbs have to learn chmod
0,[08:44] <k|oWn> and symbolic links
0,[08:44] <k|oWn> and all that
0,[08:44] <andyland> chmod 777 * -R and everybody's happy :D
0,[08:44] <k|oWn> get into the terminal = bull shit just to use java especially for ubuntu, which is supposed to entice winblows people to use it ?
0,[08:44] <k|oWn> and you have to goto the gdamn command line just for java

0,[08:50] <giacomo_c> oh god, spoke too soon, now my download speeds are worse than before
0,[08:50] <k|oWn> for me i figured out so far that it was actually loading
0,[08:50] <k|oWn> it took 15 minutes
0,[08:50] <k|oWn> someone here suggested it might be something i have connected to my USB that makes 11.04 load slow
0,[08:50] <Pritesh> k|oWn its not loading at all for me
0,[08:50] <k|oWn> yeah mine seemed like it wasnt loading at all either
0,[08:51] <Pritesh> how did you fix it ?
0,[08:51] <k_sze> I need pointers to get a Windows CE 6.0 device to communicate with Ubuntu 10.10 through TCP/IP over USB.

I have heard about rndis, but the newer versions of SynCE seem to do away with rndis, if I understand correctly.

0,[10:20] <andyland> andyland: And if you're connecting from a Windows client you need to install and x-server instance like xming over putty

0,[10:20] <nelsonsmoreira88> vagvaf: thank you
0,[10:22] <freakynl> Hi, is /var/log/messages deprecated in 11.04 or something? After upgrading to it (64 bit server from 10.10) /var/log/messages remains empty. Also don't see any config for rsyslogd to log to it, this remains after reinstalling rsyslog
0,[10:23] <Cube``> ok guys, this is really annoying. since i upgraded to ubuntu 11.04, every time i add the "Governor Plugin" to the panel, it disappears on the next reboot :SSSSS
0,[10:23] <Cube``> using xfce
0,[10:25] <securityxxxpert> Aginor: I got it working.  You take all your snapshots (delete them) up to your "current setup" then do a clonehd that way
1,[10:26] <Viking667> hm. Seems I can't actually do what i want to do, even though I can stick a window onto another desktop, I can't then switch to that desktop...
1,[10:26] <Viking667> The only thing I can do (at least inside Unity) is to switch viewports/workspaces... which I've found out, aren't desktops.
1,[10:27] <Viking667> actually, the definition I have for "putting an application onto another workspace" isn't strictly correct...
1,[10:29] <Viking667> sorry, now I'm dreadfully confused. It seems that the "Desktops" term is only used inside the General settings section of ccsm. I can't see it used anywhere else.
1,[10:29] <Viking667> so, I'm stuck with MxN viewports onto one desktop
0,[10:29] <Cube``> ok guys, this is really annoying. since i upgraded to ubuntu 11.04, every time i add the "Governor Plugin" to the panel, it disappears on the next reboot :SSSSS

0,[10:37] <ikonia> ipgd: https://help.ubuntu.com
0,[10:37] <ikonia> ipgd: that is a good starting point
0,[10:37] <ipgd> @ikonia : thx .... but i need deeper explanation
0,[10:37] <llutz> !manual | ipgd
0,[10:37] <ubottu> ipgd: The Ubuntu Manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as surfing the web, listening to music and scanning documents. With an emphasis on easy to follow instructions, it is suitable for all levels of experience. http://ubuntu-manual.org/
0,[10:38] <ikonia> ipgd: a deeper explination of what ?
0,[10:38] <ipgd> the ubuntu system
0,[10:38] <ipgd> like what /dev is
0,[10:38] <ipgd> command
0,[10:38] <ikonia> ipgd: the device file system - that's not ubuntu,that's generic linux which can be found in http://tldp.org
0,[10:38] <ipgd> i learn a bit about terminal
0,[10:38] <ipgd> oh
0,[10:38] <ipgd> @ikonia : thx for info
1,[10:39] <DawnLight> i have to have a memory indicator and cpu for unity
0,[10:39] <ipgd> what topic in tldp.org do you recomend for n00b
0,[10:40] <ikonia> ipgd: read what you need to read, we only deal with ubuntu stuff in this channel
0,[10:40] <KrisDouglas> Hello guys, I am trying to get mysql to kick in, but I am getting the following: "Failed to connect to socket /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket: No such file or directory"
0,[10:41] <ipgd> oh ... so i need to go to linux irc channel ?
0,[10:41] <barf> How can I on command line do %s/^M^M/^M/g?
0,[10:41] <ikonia> ipgd: just read the pages you need to read
0,[10:41] <barf> How can I on command line do %s/^M^M/^M/g on stdout, i e ?
0,[10:41] <ikonia> barf: that's exactly how you do it
0,[10:41] <ikonia> KrisDouglas: what command are you doing that
0,[10:41] <ikonia> barf: cat the file pipe it to sed
0,[10:41] <KrisDouglas> /etc/init.d/mysql start
0,[10:42] <ikonia> KrisDouglas: ok - and you're getting that error back ?
0,[10:42] <KrisDouglas> Yes
0,[10:42] <ikonia> KrisDouglas: ok - what version of ubuntu is this ?
0,[10:42] <freakynl> Hi, is /var/log/messages deprecated in 11.04 or something? After upgrading to it (64 bit server from 10.10) /var/log/messages remains empty. Also don't see any config for rsyslogd to log to it, this remains after reinstalling rsyslog
0,[10:42] <KrisDouglas> 11.04 fresh install
0,[10:42] <KrisDouglas> of server
0,[10:42] <ikonia> KrisDouglas: ok, so "sudo service mysql stop" what happens ?
0,[10:43] <KrisDouglas> ikonia, I think I am just an idiot...
0,[10:43] <ikonia> KrisDouglas: ok ?
0,[10:43] <KrisDouglas> ikonia, I wasn't sudoing the command, so it couldn't start
0,[10:43] <ikonia> ah
0,[10:43] <ikonia> easy to forget
0,[10:43] <KrisDouglas> odd error though, shouldn't it say please elevate?
0,[10:43] <freakynl> KrisDouglas: sudo -i :)
0,[10:44] <karthick87> How to remove games menu from Applications via terminal ?
0,[10:44] <Phoenix87> hallo
0,[10:44] <KrisDouglas> freakynl, I thought I was in that :P Didn't notice. Thanks guys
0,[10:44] <ikonia> karthick87: you don't, use the gui, that's what it's there for
0,[10:44] <barf> ikonia: I did cat file.txt | sed "s/^M//g" no effect
0,[10:44] <barf> I would like to remove newline
0,[10:45] <llutz> barf: you want "dos2unix"
0,[10:45] <llutz> !info dos2unix
0,[10:45] <karthick87> ikonia: Not possible to remove it via terminal?
0,[10:45] <ubottu> dos2unix (source: dos2unix): convert text file line endings between CRLF and LF. In component universe, is extra. Version 5.1.1-2 (natty), package size 39 kB, installed size 224 kB
0,[10:45] <deffcon> can someone tell me why i can compile openelec.tv not anymore on Ubuntu natty, this is the message i got in my terminal on compiling "**** The following packages were not installed correctly **** glibc-static" referring to /usr/lib/libc.a
0,[10:45] <dany_>  I have read about virtual hosts . But is it possible to have differtent subdomains point to different ip adresses on the LAN?
0,[10:45] <ikonia> karthick87: use the gui - it's what it's there for
0,[10:46] <llutz> barf: using sed:        sed 's/\r//' < dos.txt > unix.txt
0,[10:46] <ikonia> dany_: yes, that's just dns
0,[10:46] <Phoenix87> My machine mounts an intel video adapter, but i have xorg-server-video packages from other vendors installed and i don't know why? Is this fine?
0,[10:46] <m4rtijn> hi all
0,[10:46] <ikonia> deffcon: your current distro does not have a statlic libc library
0,[10:46] <ikonia> Phoenix87: it's fine
0,[10:46] <barf> llutz: This is output from tidy
0,[10:46] <Phoenix87> ikonia, can i remove them?
0,[10:46] <barf> -i -xml
0,[10:46] <llutz> Phoenix87: the free xorg-drivers are always installed
0,[10:46] <deffcon> **** The following packages were not installed correctly **** glibc-static
0,[10:46] <Gnea> Phoenix87: mounts it?
0,[10:47] <ikonia> Phoenix87: just leave it, they won't be taking up that much space
0,[10:47] <deffcon> anyone ? ( Ubuntu Natty )
0,[10:47] <ikonia> deffcon: I've told you
0,[10:47] <dany_> Ikonia > So i can just create a name based virtual host and create a cname DNS entry?
0,[10:47] <ikonia> deffcon: saying anyone is pointless also
0,[10:47] <KrisDouglas> Ok, I have a real question now.. It's more mysql than Ubuntu but I'm going to ask. Our old ubuntu server died because of a catastrophic permissions cockup. I followed someone's advice in the channel which was to rip the /var/lib/mysql database to a backup and reinstal.
0,[10:47] <ikonia> dany_: it's that simple
0,[10:47] <dany_> WOW thanx :D
0,[10:48] <KrisDouglas> I have got to the stage where I have loaded them back, but when I start mysql, it is unusually slow and it doesn't seem to work. I can't connect to mysql when it starts.
0,[10:48] <Phoenix87> ikonia, so they do not conflict, right? 'cause i've been experiencing some video issues lately. I've reported a bug about xorg-server problems with intel chipset
0,[10:48] <barf> llutz: I tried sed 's/\n//' < dos.txt > unix.txt no go :-(
0,[10:48] <ikonia> Phoenix87: they are fine
0,[10:48] <Phoenix87> ikonia, thank you :D
0,[10:48] <ikonia> KrisDouglas: you should have dumped and imported the databases
0,[10:48] <KrisDouglas> ikonia, I couldn't.
0,[10:48] <KrisDouglas> That was the only way I could get what I had.
0,[10:48] <m4rtijn> i have a small problem: im at a terminal server client.. and i would like to install netbeans 7 -- if I ssh admin@ts and ./netbeans-install.sh I cant install to /usr/share -- message: read only -- am i going at it the wrong way??
0,[10:49] <mihaibivol> hello, I have upgraded to 11.04 and the booting process stops after checking battery state. I have an nvidia G103M video adapter, i think that can be the problem
0,[10:49] <ikonia> KrisDouglas: so what's the actual problem
0,[10:51] <m4rtijn> also, if I do sudo -i and try the install.sh I get the error: rejected, wrong authentication
0,[10:52] <cvam> math library functions cannot be used with gcc compiler.It shows Undefined reference to
0,[10:52] <KrisDouglas> ikonia, All the files have been restored, but mysql doesn't seem to be starting properly.
0,[10:52] <ikonia> "doesn't seem to be starting properly" you need to be more specific
0,[10:53] <m4rtijn> KrisDouglas: tail -f /var/log/mysql/error.log
0,[10:53] <freakynl> what package delivers /etc/rsyslog.d/*? Reinstalling rsyslog doesn't return the files
0,[10:54] <barf> This one adds \r to \n: sed 's/$'"/`echo \\\r`/" I need to remove \n
0,[10:54] <llutz> freakynl: you'd have to purge that package, then re-install
0,[10:54] <llutz> barf:       sed 's/\r//'
0,[10:55] <barf> 0x0a
0,[10:55] <barf> there is not \r
0,[10:56] <freakynl> llutz: thx, still nothing going to /var/log/messages tho' (at least, not according to the config), is that normal?
0,[10:57] <llutz> freakynl: seems to be normal, lots of guys asked about
0,[10:57] <m4rtijn> ah, admin@ts then sudo ./install.sh worked
0,[10:57] <m4rtijn> bb
0,[10:57] <freakynl> llutz: ok thx
0,[10:57] <barf> sed 's/\n//' still no good
1,[10:58] <Shogoot> hi people. ive updated to 11.04, from 10.04, but the dash thingy is not showing up when i press "applications" any suggestion to how i can make it work?

0,[11:04] <freakynl> I know my math isn't that great, but these things frequently have me stumped: /dev/md4               11T  498G  9.8T   5% /mnt/export

0,[11:05] <llutz> phonex01: take it to #ubuntu-offtopic please
0,[11:05] <tamer> hello, I setup an adhoc network (WEP) between two Ubuntu machines, but it's slow. Any ideas what could be wrong?
0,[11:05] <freakynl> tamer: yea, wireless sucks
0,[11:06] <freakynl> tamer: seriously, if you get 20M*bit* on a 54Mbit wlan, you should praise the lord for being that lucky
0,[11:06] <jiltdil> channel for open solaris please?
0,[11:06] <tamer> freakynl, no, it's not the usual slow wireless, it's slower
0,[11:06] <tamer> freakynl, an adhoc between a Windows and Ubuntu is much faster
1,[11:06] <ericP> when upgrading to 11.04, i acquired a mac-like task bar and menu motif, which i guess is Unity. because i use mouse focus, i can rarely get all the way to the menu bar without it changing as i pass over another app's window
1,[11:07] <ericP> pouring through the settings (under the off button?), i've not found a way to hide the task bar or leave menus attached to app windows
0,[11:07] <jiltdil> channel for open solaris ?
0,[11:07] <freakynl> tamer: with the same hardware, same location, same distance, no microwave running both times, etc?
0,[11:08] <llutz> jiltdil: /msg alis list *opensolaris*
0,[11:08] <tamer> freakynl, yes.
0,[11:08] <jiltdil> llutz:thanks
1,[11:08] <ericP> is it easy to switch to some other application manager besides Unity?
0,[11:08] <freakynl> does it matter if comp a or comp b is the windows part (to determine whether one of the devices might have sub-optimal drivers)?
0,[11:09] <ouyes>  I get a thinkpad t400 in hands, there is a problem about the light, when you watch a movie in night, there are a few indicating lamp for telling you the status of the laptop, but the lights of the lamp are so strong in the night, it influence the view of the screen when you watch a movie, is there a way to dim the indicating lamps? of course I am running ubuntu
0,[11:11] <tamer> freakynl, except it's a WEP connection now (because i am not able to get it to work using WPA), it was WPA between the Windows and Ubuntu machines before.
0,[11:12] <phonex01> tamer use compat-wireless drivers
0,[11:12] <dany_> does anyone know hot to correctly set the document root for a different LAN  ip adress with a virtualhost? (for a subdomain

0,[11:18] <freaky[t]> !gnome3
1,[11:19] <ubottu> Gnome 3 is not currently supported on Ubuntu. A PPA for natty is available at https://launchpad.net/~gnome3-team/+archive/gnome3 but these packages are EXPERIMENTAL and UNSTABLE, will break Unity and possibly other parts of your system, and safe downgrading is not possible.

0,[11:22] <venkatesh> joshual : but i have my project data in it can u help me to fix it....please
0,[11:23] <vagvaf> venkatesh: you can boot from a live cd and retrieve your data
0,[11:23] <venkatesh> vagvaf: can u please tell how can i do that
0,[11:24] <zatan> Hi, is there anyway from terminal to change that default shell gnome-classic ?
0,[11:24] <venkatesh> vagvaf : can i install gdm package from live cd
0,[11:24] <m_fulder> hello
0,[11:24] <barbadillo> hi all, can I just update from 10.04 to 11.04 or I have to go through 10.10?
0,[11:25] <red> venkatesh: i would start from trying to install it in that case
0,[11:25] <vagvaf> venkatesh:  do u have an ubuntu live cd ? if yes, then boot from it, choose "try ubuntu" instead of install and then open your hardrive and copy/paste your data on a usb stick or at another location
0,[11:25] <m_fulder> while I write sendmail -t in my terminal I got the error message: sendmail: fatal: open /etc/postfix/main.cf: No such file or directory  how do I solve this? what should I see when just typing in sendmail??
0,[11:26] <venkatesh> vagvaf : can i install gdm package from live cd
0,[11:26] <llutz> m_fulder: sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix
0,[11:26] <SmokeyD> hey everyone. I have logged in through ssh on my ubuntu machine at work. I installed tightvncserver on it, and now want to start it. but I can't start a server listening om port 5901 as normal user, but also don't want to start tightvncserver as root because I want to work on my own account
0,[11:26] <venkatesh> red : can u please tell me how to install it
0,[11:26] <SmokeyD> any clues how to solve this?
0,[11:26] <llutz> m_fulder: or if you just need a smtp-server to send some mails, use msmtp/ssmtp or nullmailer
0,[11:26] <vagvaf> venkatesh: you probably can, but i'm not sure how are you going to do it. i wield the floor to red :)
0,[11:27] <Jasonn> SmokeyD: sudo STARTNAMEHERE
0,[11:27] <venkatesh> red: can i install gdm package from live cd
0,[11:27] <SmokeyD> Jasonn: no that won't work. With sudo tightvncserver wants the config files to be owned by the same user that runs the vncserver
0,[11:28] <Jasonn> SmokeyD: Start it as root, and then log into your account
0,[11:28] <m_fulder> llutz, Im also hosting a webserver on this machine and while trying to send mail with PHP it fails ... so I thought that was because of sendmail failing ... I still need to fix sendmail => postfix to get it working properly ? Or can I still use smtp ?
0,[11:28] <red> venkatesh: you could try "sudo apt-get install libdbus" (and then hit TAB a few times to see if there is anything by the name avaialable)
0,[11:29] <barbadillo> m_fulder, you have to install postfix
0,[11:29] <llutz> m_fulder: better use a simple smtp-mailer like those above than a "monster" like postfix
0,[11:29] <venkatesh> red : no there is no names available
0,[11:29] <smotko__> Hello
0,[11:29] <red> can't help you more then, i'm sorry
0,[11:29] <llutz> m_fulder: postfix is fine but overkill for just sending some mails
0,[11:29] <Jasonn> SmokeyD: Or you can try giving yourself temp root access
0,[11:29] <bbox> sub
0,[11:29] <bbox> hi
0,[11:29] <mmiliauskas> hi
0,[11:30] <evenflow> hello, im using ubuntu 10.10 and am unable to access single user mode from grub
0,[11:30] <bbox> anyone here
0,[11:30] <m_fulder> barbadillo, llutz : ah then I get it ... but will still the mail() function be able to use another oackage then postfix? (maybe if I specify it in the php.ini?)
0,[11:30] <venkatesh> red: when i try apt-get install libdbus* is giving " Err could not resolve archive.ubuntu.com"
0,[11:30] <SmokeyD> Jasonn, when I logout in vnc, I don't get a loginscreen anymore, so starting as root and then logging out doesn't work
0,[11:30] <llutz> m_fulder: it should be able to use any installed mta
0,[11:30] <Jasonn> SmokeyD: Give your useraccount root privelages.
0,[11:31] <barbadillo> m_fulder, you can have only one mta on your system
0,[11:31] <Jasonn> SmokeyD: sudo adduser YOURUSERNAME root
0,[11:31] <venkatesh> red: when i try apt-get install libdbus* is giving " Err could not resolve archive.ubuntu.com"
0,[11:31] <m_fulder> ah only one :O
0,[11:31] <red> venkatesh: perhaps your internet connection is inactive
0,[11:31] <mmiliauskas> I have some strange problem, when I try to run php script in the background "php script.php &", script is stopped automatically, if I neglect ampersand then everything works but not in the background
0,[11:31] <red> can you "ping archive.ubuntu.com"
0,[11:31] <m_fulder> well will try some out and check how they works out thanks barbadillo and llutz
0,[11:31] <barbadillo> m_fulder, what's the problem with postfix?
0,[11:31] <SmokeyD> Jasonn, how can I give my account privileges to start a program listening on port 590x?
0,[11:31] <venkatesh> red ...ya its pinging...
0,[11:31] <m_fulder> barbadillo, dunno nothing atm Im installing it :P
0,[11:31] <devish> & this is fo BG only
0,[11:31] <red> odd that apt-get cannot resolve the name in that case
0,[11:31] <Jasonn> SmokeyD: give the account root privelages, but make sure the pass ou have is secure
0,[11:32] <liujixin> 大家好
0,[11:32] <liujixin> 谁在
0,[11:32] <mmiliauskas> devish, what do you mean?

0,[11:32] <liujixin> 看不懂
0,[11:32] <SmokeyD> Jasonn: how do I give an account root privileges. There is only one root account. I can add the account to several other groups, but which one do I need to add my account to then?
0,[11:33] <liujixin> 我不会认识英文呢的呢

0,[11:34] <saimanoj> i want to create another user account for my sis. But it is unable to mount drives from that account
0,[11:34] <Jasonn> SmokeyD: Try another VNC program, because I have never hadthis issue before
0,[11:35] <devish> mmiliauskas: might be thats all it can do

0,[11:35] <devish> mmiliauskas: you can use >>file.txt to get the required info

0,[11:35] <SmokeyD> Jasonn: you mean to say you have always been able to launch programs on privileged ports as a normal user?
0,[11:35] <red> venkatesh: try "sudo startx" again
0,[11:36] <saimanoj> how to give those privelages
0,[11:36] <Jasonn> SmokeyD: No, I am saying that normal vnc programs dont require root to run

0,[11:37] <Jasonn> saimanoj:  :D
1,[11:37] <jiltdil> which is better gnome3 or unity?
0,[11:37] <SmokeyD> Jasonn: any program listening on a priviliged port needs root privileges. All the services in /etc/init.d/ also need to be started with sudo.
0,[11:37] <llutz> saimanoj: sudo adduser "user" admin                   not sudo

0,[11:54] <mrkrrtft> Hi all.  I've had a problem getting wireless to work in 11.04 since RC1.  I've searched and read bug reports on Launchpad, but none of them fix my issue.  I can connect just fine to my access point in 10.10.  The error is wifi keeps cycling and then ending.  Logs stat that association took too long and then it deactivates the device and never connects.  Any ideas?

0,[11:55] <Viking667> mrkrrtft: heh. And I have yet another wireless problem - I can't set my computer up as an AP...
0,[11:55] <ThinkT510> serif: what is the package you are trying to install and from where are you getting it?
0,[11:55] <serif> eg from getdeb site
0,[11:55] <mrkrrtft> serif: you need to save it before you install it.  Otherwise the temp file that is created when "running from the internet" doesn't work correctly.
0,[11:56] <wodim> how does one disable a service at startup?
0,[11:56] <connor__> my battery metre is not showing

0,[11:58] <ThinkT510> serif: like mrkrrtft said, you have to save it then install

0,[11:58] <connor__> can you help me ubuntu 11.04 is a bit slow on my acer aspire one

0,[11:58] <Viking667> wodim: I often wander into /etc/init and find the service to disable, rename the .conf file so it's something like myservice.conf.disabled

0,[12:01] <Viking667> connor__: which cube?
0,[12:01] <jimrew> yes think
0,[12:01] <fooztha> What does "Read Error" indicate at boot?
0,[12:01] <connor__> the workspace switcher cube that ive heard about
0,[12:01] <ThinkT510> jimrew: it's a big channel, tell us your problem and somebody may help you
0,[12:01] <Viking667> That may be a CCSM module (compiz Configuration settings manager, I think it means)
0,[12:01] <jimrew> will ubuntu continu to have gnome 2 to download???
0,[12:02] <Viking667> I've just been playing with that tonight actually.
0,[12:02] <connor__> ok ill install compiz
0,[12:02] <Viking667> jimrew: I hope so...

0,[12:02] <jimrew> well will it?
1,[12:02] <Viking667> I'm getting a little tired of Unity... and I've only run it for two days
0,[12:02] <venkatesh> devish : can i install gdm packge to my system using a live cd
0,[12:02] <Viking667> jimrew: all I can say is: check what's in your repositories...
0,[12:02] <karthick87> Is there any alternative to ping tester software ?
0,[12:03] <jimrew> i cant use gnome 3 i dont like it
0,[12:03] <Viking667> can't use???
0,[12:03] <plouffe> what could happen if you unplug an external USB disk while it is still mounted?
0,[12:03] <jimrew> i like gnome 2
0,[12:03] <mrkrrtft> karthick87: regular "ping" doesn't work?
0,[12:03] <Viking667> heh. You and me both...
0,[12:03] <jimrew> you like gnome 2?
0,[12:03] <karthick87> mrkrrtft: Yeah it is working. But i need time with the ping report..
0,[12:03] <connor__> so im installing compiz what do i do after that
0,[12:03] <ThinkT510> jimrew: gnome 2 won't be around forever, i like xfce
0,[12:04] <mrkrrtft> karthick87: you mean date/time stamp?
0,[12:04] <karthick87> mrkrrtft: Yes
0,[12:04] <jimrew> how about a commuity porject?
0,[12:04] <ajdonnison> plouffe, you could end up with data not written to the drive, and an inconsistent filesystem.  You may need to run fsck on in the next time you mount it.
0,[12:04] <connor__> what do i do after i install compiz
0,[12:05] <plouffe> ajdonnison, could any of this occur if I didn't write anything to the disk since mount?
1,[12:05] <jimrew> why is ubuntu puting gnome 3 in with unity?
0,[12:05] <devish`> venkatesh: that depends whether your cd has that package or not
0,[12:05] <Glycan> Sorry, I missed my answer: Can I make a live usb out of grub?
0,[12:05] <ajdonnison> plouffe, there is always a possibility, although in practice it is unlikely.
0,[12:05] <ThinkT510> jimrew: i'm sure if there is enough interest there may be a community project to continue gnome 2 (like trinity for kde3), but this is getting off-topic
0,[12:05] <mrkrrtft> brb
0,[12:05] <plouffe> ajdonnison, thanks
0,[12:05] <devish`> if it has then then you can
1,[12:05] <connor__> how do you install unity web player on ubuntu
0,[12:05] <fooztha> What does "Read Error" indicate at boot?
0,[12:06] <jimrew> oh sory dude i just like gnome 2
0,[12:06] <ajdonnison> plouffe, it depends on the filesystem type of the drive, though.
0,[12:06] <xbmcuser> help anyone? i want to access tvheadends webGUI. I can access it from the lan, but don't know how to get in using my IP
1,[12:06] <Viking667> I'd have to look at Gnome 3 and evaluate that separately from Unity. Frankly I'm not a fan of Unity, but hey. I haven't run it for a full month, so I'm hardly qualified to really comment.
0,[12:06] <Glycan> (The firmware on the box I'm trying to fix points to a broken bootstraper, e.g. the half-deleted windwos one)
0,[12:06] <Glycan> Well?
0,[12:06] <plouffe> ajdonnison, so fat or ntfs drives have that problem?
1,[12:06] <jimrew> i like unity to but gnome 2 is better
0,[12:06] <jimrew> and KDe
0,[12:07] <mrkrrtft> for the ping with a time stamp here is a script someone ran. don't know if it will work though.  ......    http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1212848

0,[12:07] <jimrew> alsamixer
0,[12:07] <jimrew> go to alsamixer
0,[12:08] <connor__> this place isnt any help
0,[12:08] <ajdonnison> plouffe, not sure about that.  Unix file systems tend to mark the filesystem as dirty on mount so you need to clear that flag before it will mount cleanly again.

0,[12:14] <Glycan> botcity, can _you_ help me? Grub is slightly dead.
0,[12:14] <kali`> glycan, you'll have to wait a while
0,[12:14] <hw> Think: thanks didnt know that
0,[12:15] <Glycan> Oh, no, nothing, I just have this problem that I've been asking for 3 days, and no-one has helped me much so far.
0,[12:15] <ThinkT510> hw: np
0,[12:15] <Glycan> I have been, for three days...
0,[12:15] <m_fulder> barbadillo, you still here? :P
0,[12:15] <kali`> thinkt510, it happens on the desktop distro as well
0,[12:15] <ThinkT510> Glycan: it sounds like you are not familiar with partitioning
0,[12:15] <mouzil> adamJ: then I have to type: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:weather-indicator-team ??
0,[12:16] <botcity> Glycan, you say you have deleted windows! then i would use a live disk to make the free space a ext3 partition. is a clean install out of the question?
0,[12:16] <ThinkT510> kali`: what does?
0,[12:16] <adamJ> mouzil:that should be right
0,[12:16] <Fahmida> Ah solved it. Thanks everyone. :D
0,[12:16] <kali`> the problem hw  is experiencing, thinkt510
0,[12:16] <mouzil> adamJ: thank you, I'll try that
0,[12:16] <ThinkT510> kali`: oh
0,[12:16] <Glycan> ThinkT510: I am not.
0,[12:17] <Glycan> Yes, clean install is indeed out of the question- There are some slightly important stuff there.
1,[12:17] <connor__> help the applications on my sidebar just disapeared ubuntu11.04
0,[12:17] <ThinkT510> Glycan: from your description above it sounds as if you deleted the windows partition for space and now you can access windows and wonder why
0,[12:18] <ThinkT510> Glycan: sorry if i misunderstand what you wrote
1,[12:18] <connor__> applications on my side bar disapeered
0,[12:18] <ThinkT510> Glycan: *can't
0,[12:18] <Glycan> No- deleded /host/Windows/*.*- evrything else is there- program files, kernel (presumably) and so on.
0,[12:19] <LeeDrOiD-DHD> guys, any news/solutions for the blank screen issue on 11.04, acer aspire one aoa150, managet to boot using 2.6.38-8
0,[12:19] <Glycan> Misforntune upon me- as soon I am close to geting help, I must go. An email I will recive stuff from is mkggame@gmail.com
0,[12:19] <Glycan> But I am still here for ten minutes.
0,[12:20] <botcity> Glycan, will it boot ?
0,[12:20] <Glycan> Er, ThinkT510?
0,[12:20] <Glycan> Will whom boot?
0,[12:20] <ThinkT510> Glycan: yes?
0,[12:20] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: so you did a dual install (side-by-side Windows and Ubuntu) and then decided to delete the Windows directory files?
0,[12:20] <Glycan> Yes,
0,[12:20] <Glycan> Exactly.
0,[12:21] <Pumpkin-> "(!$&!*"&$!, so grub2 has a 1.x version number. That makes SO much sense. I'm correct though yeah ?
0,[12:21] <kali`> and now it's not booting linux?
0,[12:21] <Glycan> As far as I understand, I need to put a bootloader that works on a liveCD.
0,[12:21] <Glycan> BEfore it booted window's bootloader, first thing.
0,[12:21] <botcity> Glycan, and extend the linux distro to fill the empty space ?
0,[12:21] <Glycan> ?
0,[12:21] <Glycan> botcity, what do you mean?
0,[12:22] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: let's step back one step.  What is the ultimate goal you are trying to reach?
0,[12:22] <jinppk> hey peeps, im on 11.04 and compiz is loseing it... its up to 67
0,[12:22] <Glycan> From window's bootloader, I could load grub, and then U. I'm trying to get to U, and make it so that I don't get this again.
0,[12:22] <jinppk> hey peeps, im on 11.04 and compiz is loseing it... its up to 67% memory useage and on idle at least 10% cpu, i have 4gig ram and a Q6600 cpu
0,[12:22] <kali`> you upgraded too soon jinppk ;)
0,[12:22] <jinppk> obviously
0,[12:22] <jinppk> ...
0,[12:23] <jinppk> is this a known bug?
0,[12:23] <Glycan> So I assume that I should first put GRUB on a liveusb/cd, to get acces, and then somehow change what the firmware points to.
0,[12:23] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: So right now the Windows bootloader isn't working?
0,[12:23] <Glycan> Yes.
0,[12:23] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: hold on a sec.
0,[12:23] <Glycan> Ditto windows, obv.
0,[12:23] <genjix> g++ $1 -lboost_system -lboost_thread -Wall -Wextra -std=c++0x -pedantic

0,[12:24] <genjix> natty narwhal - any ideas?
0,[12:25] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: I knew I saw this page somewhere before.  Here is an Ubuntu wiki page that shows you how to recover Grub.  You do need an Ubuntu Live CD.  ..............    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
1,[12:25] <sss314> How do I add a directory to the left menu of Natty Ubuntu?
0,[12:25] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: I think that will help.
0,[12:25] <Glycan> mrkrrtft, botcity, ThinkT510, et all, I have to go in five minuets. Please email me about what I Should do at mkggame@gmail.com
0,[12:25] <Glycan> Oh.
0,[12:25] <jcmarini> later
0,[12:25] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: save that URL and it should help you out.
0,[12:25] <Glycan> I have a live cd of ubuntu- it doesn't work.
0,[12:26] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: Unfortunately that is a requirement for what you need done.  You *will* need an Ubuntu Live CD.
0,[12:27] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: maybe download a new ISO, do an MD5 check on it, before you burn it, to make sure it downloaded correctly.
0,[12:27] <Glycan> Okay..
0,[12:27] <Glycan> What's a good ISO burner for windows?
0,[12:27] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: what version of Windows do you have?
0,[12:27] <botcity> Glycan, and burn at the slowest speed.

1,[12:28] <adit> guys can any one point an alternative to metacity keybindings in Unity
0,[12:28] <DogEars> Hi, I installed Virtualbox-ose instead of Virtualbox4.0 what is the difference?
0,[12:29] <tramm> Please, tell me how do Ubuntu people call the greeting screen of Live CD which gives choices to "Try Ubuntu" or "Install Ubuntu"? Maybe you can even point me out where the background image of this greeting screen is defined? Thanks in advance!
0,[12:29] <sockbanana> is this the right channel for noobs
1,[12:29] <sss314> How do I a directory shortcut to the left menu bar of Unity?
0,[12:29] <Guest1884> tramm, do you mean maybe "gdm" ... Gnome Desktop Manager?
0,[12:30] <Glycan> WinXP
0,[12:30] <Glycan> I did.
0,[12:30] <ThinkT510> sockbanana: this is ubuntu support, need any help?

0,[12:30] <Guest1884> tramm, sorry it's Display not Desktop :)
0,[12:30] <S2D0> Any idea why gedit doesn't have the same gtk look as my other applications? It's got the raw one.
0,[12:30] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: for free software I have had good luck with ISO Recorder.  ...................             http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm
0,[12:31] <mrkrrtft> Glycan: good luck.  Make sure to back up your data before you try anything though.
1,[12:31] <adit> ThinkT510 : metacity keybindings alternative for Unity plz
0,[12:31] <Guest1884> S2D0, it has been compiled with different configuration directories? and cannot find your GTK config?? just a guess...
0,[12:31] <tramm> Guest1884: Is it the same screen for Login menu and the "Install/try Ubuntu" choices? It could be, I'll check it out, thanks!
1,[12:31] <ThinkT510> adit: i don't use unity or metacity so i can't help sorry, i'm more of an xfce guy
0,[12:32] <Guest1884> tramm, i'm not sure ... if that's before Linux is booting, it could be GRUB .. after your Ubuntu boots, the Login presented is GDM
0,[12:33] <adit> ThinkT510 do you use any program for keybindings ?
0,[12:33] <botcity> adit, why do you need an alterantive ?
0,[12:33] <sockbanana> I just installed ubuntu on a usb (first) time using any king of linux system (loving it). I have the most basic question, may you could refer me to a faq. How do I instal packages? sorry

0,[12:45] <morning> Having trouble with what should be an ordinary task: using a standard USB memory stick. Ubuntu at first saw it as an "8GB" file system & listed the content with wild-looking filenames. I put the stick in a Windows machine, which then reported it as corrupt. I reformatted it there. Now Ubuntu doesn't see it. I've had trouble with Ubuntu & USB sticks before. For me, at least, it doesn't at all "just work." What to do? (The version is Natty

0,[13:09] <morning> Celthunder: Yes, I have ntfs-3g installed. But in any case: I deliberately formatted the stick as FAT-32.
0,[13:09] <celthunder> astro_: there you go
0,[13:09] <DogWater> Is there a kickstart generator for Ubuntu or does anyone have an example of an Ubuntu desktop system kickstart?
0,[13:09] <ThinkT510> vamsi: not sure sorry, it is likely an issue with the nvidia driver and ubuntu can fix it because its proprietry
0,[13:09] <ThinkT510> cant*
0,[13:09] <celthunder> morning: do you have uatofs installed and set up properly?
0,[13:09] <morning> Celthunder: will check.
0,[13:09] <astro_> celthunder, kool, yeah so spamming the shift keys is like the only way to get the login manger to appear
0,[13:09] <vamsi> How to fix the issue permanently
0,[13:10] <celthunder> vamsi: add nomodeset to grub.cfg
0,[13:10] <astro_> celthunder, but i can get to the login screen everytime on the older kernel version but i can login
0,[13:10] <vamsi> How to add that ?
0,[13:10] <morning> Celthunder: Uatofs? Don't know what it is & don't see it in the repos.
0,[13:10] <vamsi> when i used 11.04 i didnt find the new features
0,[13:11] <celthunder> morning: autofs sorry typo
0,[13:11] <morning> Celthunder: Thanks. Checking. . .
0,[13:11] <yuan> 11.04 is a beta one
0,[13:11] <celthunder> astro_: did you try a different login manager like slim/kdm? make sure it's gdm that's the issue?
0,[13:12] <rkvirani> exit
0,[13:12] <astro_> celthunder, how would i do that? is it just install from the software center?
0,[13:12] <morning> Celthunder: No, not installed. Repo says, "This transitional package helps users to transition from the autofs package to
0,[13:12] <morning> the autofs5 package. Once this package and its dependencies are installed you can safely remove it." (I don't have autofs5 installed either.)
0,[13:12] <astro_> celthunder, sorry mate im a bit of a nub.
0,[13:13] <celthunder> astro_: yeah it should be in the repo's
0,[13:13] <vamsi> How to add nomodeset to grub.cfg ?
0,[13:14] <celthunder> morning: ok all it really does is monitor for devices and automounts them according to settings you specify and unmounts them automatically
0,[13:14] <morning> Celthunder: So then I should give it a try?
0,[13:14] <celthunder> vamsi: on your install? from the livecd mount your /boot partition in /tmp somewhere and then vi /tmp/a/boot/grub.cfg find the line and add it
0,[13:15] <astro_> celthunder, and to clarify thats the correct spelling of the application? also how do i make slim/kdm the default login service?
0,[13:15] <Dr_Willis> vamsi:  edit your /etc/default/grub is how i do it.
0,[13:15] <vamsi> when i used 11.04 i didnt find the new features
0,[13:15] <Pici> vamsi: If you're using grub2 (the default) modify /etc/default/grub , specificly GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, then follow the instructions at the top of that file.
0,[13:15] <celthunder> morning: it's what i use, have had no problems with usb
0,[13:15] <mah454> where is youtube video cache in ubuntu-11.04 ? (in 10.10 is /tmp)
0,[13:15] <morning> Celthunder: Thanks. Will try.
0,[13:15] <kali`> do i need to install packages to get iptables with nat support?
0,[13:15] <kali`> it's been a while since i configured nat on my other server
0,[13:15] <celthunder> astro_: slim/kdm are two different programs, kdm is for kde slim is more general both work with any DE though.  and yes both are spelt right
0,[13:16] <kali`> i thought iptables could do it on its own
0,[13:16] <Pici> dmart: You're joining and quitting a lot, we'd appreciate if you parted the ubuntu channels you're in while you fix whatever you're doing, as you're creating a lot of noise.
0,[13:16] <kali`> but now i'm not so sure
0,[13:16] <celthunder> kali`: it should be able to on its own...

1,[13:23] <viskos> After update from 10.10 to 11.04 my desktop is missing. The backround pic is showing but the Unfiy seems to be missing. What to do? Format?
0,[13:23] <evenflow> hello, after update my ubuntu 10.10 freezes, when i try to get into recovery mode or single user mode it just stalls when it reaches: "firewire core: created device fw0:...", i suspect this has something to do with display as when i try to do a normal boot it reaches the ubuntu screen and freezes
1,[13:24] <__Alex_> viskos: try to type: 'sudo aptitude reinstall ubuntu-desktop'
0,[13:24] <Dr_Willis> viskos:  were you usuing the Autologin feature? or the netbook edition?
0,[13:24] <ShawnRisk> how do I make sure that my wireless connection stays connected at all times?  I am using Ubuntu 11.04.  Maybe this is the password is not saved or knows what connection to look for.  Ideas?
0,[13:24] <viskos> Auto login
0,[13:24] <Pici> deffcon: It doest look like we ship libc.a in that path. Heres a paste with the packages that ship that file: http://paste.ubuntu.com/603689/
0,[13:24] <Dr_Willis> viskos:  saw a friend today, his 'auto login' was set to the wrong desktop enviroment.
0,[13:24] <kali`> fixed it!
0,[13:25] <viskos> Do I use th Ctrl At F12 to fins terminal?
0,[13:25] <Dr_Willis> viskos:   his was set to 'une' instead of 'ubuntu'
0,[13:25] <ErezCohen> hey guys, Can i list only the directories in a backup file? all i find is the -tzvf commands.... 10x :-)
0,[13:25] <Dr_Willis> I would suggest logging out to the GDM screen and seeing if you can select a differnt desktop.
1,[13:25] <coachj> if i run 11.4 from live CD will unity run?
0,[13:25] <__Alex_> ShawnRisk: Are you using 'Network Manager' or 'WICD'?
0,[13:25] <kali`> dr_willis, your friend is a guinea pig ;)
0,[13:25] <Dr_Willis> I also suggest disabling autologin in gdm for now viskos .
0,[13:25] <astro_> celthunder, ok, cool and i am guessing the location of the kdm bin file is the same, just replace gdm with kdm?
0,[13:25] <viskos> aha I will check that
0,[13:26] <Dr_Willis> kali`:  yep. He had a netbook edition that has been upgraded time and time again. its still using Grub1
0,[13:26] <ShawnRisk> __Alex_: I am not near the laptop at the moment, but I believe I installed both.
0,[13:26] <Dr_Willis> kali`:  i just happened to notice the gdm configs had him autologing in to 'une'
1,[13:27] <zvacet> coachj:  it should
0,[13:27] <ErezCohen> come on, help a nurd.....LOL
0,[13:27] <coachj> zvacet; ok thks
0,[13:27] <viskos> What command on the kayboard do I use for the GDM screen?
0,[13:27] <Flippo_> hi ! is there a command to activate "shift" ? in order to avoid to push the buttons
0,[13:27] <viskos> And terminal?
0,[13:28] <Dr_Willis> viskos:  somthing like 'sudo service gdm stop' or 'start' or 'restart' depending on wha tyou want to do.
0,[13:28] <kali`> dr_willis, haha
0,[13:28] <kali`> when's the next lts release scheduled? will it be 12.04?

0,[13:29] <kali`> 12.04.. etc
0,[13:29] <zvacet> viskos: you can use ctrl+f1 to f6 and ctrl +f7 to go back to gui
0,[13:29] <karthick87> I am unable to connect to windows domain from ubuntu, Can anyone help me ?
0,[13:29] <zvacet> kali`:  10.10
0,[13:29] <viskos> Thanks!!
0,[13:29] <zvacet> *11.10
0,[13:30] <kali`> zvacet, that's the lts? i thought lts always end on *.04
0,[13:30] <popey> kali`: 12.04 is the next LTS
0,[13:30] <popey> kali`: its roughly every 2 years
0,[13:30] <kali`> but yeah, six months between releases no matter how mature they are
0,[13:30] <arquebus> Erez- just list files? ls -a
0,[13:30] <kali`> ah popey
0,[13:30] <morning> celthunder: Autofs5 seems to have solved the issue. Thank you.
0,[13:30] <zvacet> kali: overlooked that you are asking about lts yes 12.04
0,[13:31] <__Alex_> ShawnRisk: Try to remove network-manager and network-manager-gnome with aptitude, reboot, install WICD if not yet, finding your wireless (If it shows nothing, go to preferences, if the 'Wireless interface:' box is empty, put there 'wlan0'), reboot again, click the WICD traybar icon again, find your network, click preferences, type there the key, click ok, and tick the 'Automatically connect' tickbox, and you should be done
0,[13:31] <jiohdi> this may seem like a stupid question, but is there any danger in leaving a ROOT terminal open?
0,[13:31] <ErezCohen> arquebus, I'm stupid but not that stupid, LOL.... i am looking to list the directories in the backup file....not the ones in the linux
0,[13:32] <CalicoJack> jiohdi: like... in a public place?
0,[13:32] <kali`> jiohdi, if someone walks in and starts typing in it yes
0,[13:32] <jiohdi> CalicoJack, no just on the computer
0,[13:32] <jiohdi> I mean from internet
0,[13:32] <frostschutz> jiohdi: or if you accidentally paste some commands into the wrong window... I killed a root server this way once, wanted to format something locally, ended up formatting the serv :D
0,[13:32] <kali`> nice frostschutz
0,[13:33] <CalicoJack> jiohdi: principle of least privilege suggests that this is, in general, a bad idea

0,[13:36] <Wolf_22> If you get a 403 "Forbidden" when trying to access a LAMP host, is that enough leeway to at least be convinced that the server is up and running--just not adjusted for visitors?
0,[13:38] <zvacet> __Alex_: if I remember correctly I installed wicd but not remove nm I think it was removed by wicd install or was intact because wicd take it's place

0,[13:48] <karthick87> How to disable USB ?
0,[13:48] <bazhang_> karthick87, why would you want to
0,[13:48] <Distress> put gum in the usb port
0,[13:49] <karthick87> bazhang_: Do you want a reason ? Its a  database company, so we have to block the USB port..
1,[13:49] <nonesoblind> For some reason the application menu (file | edit | view...)  isn't appearing for some apps, for example, Chrome and Virtualbox. Anyone run into this problem before?
1,[13:49] <bazhang_> nonesoblind, on unity? check the app name in the top panel for them
0,[13:50] <tom1> hello, I am trying to create a MEX file using Matlab R2008a  in Ubuntu 11.04. It is worked fine in the previous 4 Ubuntu releases, but I now get some sort of library error (I think)...http://paste.ubuntu.com/603697/
0,[13:50] <Pici> karthick87: I suppose you could blacklist the kernel module(s) that provide usb support.
1,[13:50] <nonesoblind> Yes sorry unity on 11.04.  What do you mean by check the top panel?  The app menu options (file, edit, view, etc) are appearing for terminal but not Virtualbox or Chrome
0,[13:50] <Distress> hover the top panal nonesoblind
0,[13:50] <Distress> panel*
0,[13:50] <Distress> in chrome
0,[13:51] <Distress> kinda like in OSX
1,[13:51] <nonesoblind> I understand how it's supposed to work...what I am saying is it's working for some apps and not others
0,[13:51] <karthick87> Pici: I just want to block only storage devices, because Mouse and keyboards are connected via USB ports.
0,[13:51] <Distress> ah
1,[13:51] <CalicoJack> nonesoblind: well, that is because unity is inconsistent
0,[13:51] <Distress> karthick87,  is that even possible? disable all usb devices or disable none
0,[13:52] <Pici> karthick87: hmm..
0,[13:52] <CalicoJack> nonesoblind: some apps move menus to the top, some leave them in the traditional place.  in the case of chrome, it doesn't use a menu like the one you are describing
1,[13:52] <jrdnyquist> dang, http://amplicate.com/hate/unity
0,[13:52] <nonesoblind> Calicojack: it actually worked yesterday and it's not working today.
0,[13:52] <CalicoJack> nonesoblind: click on the wrench on the right hand side of the chrome window
0,[13:53] <karthick87> Distress: As i said i want to disable only external storage devices like USB harddisk or flash drives..
0,[13:53] <bazhang_> jrdnyquist, thats not on topic here
0,[13:53] <jrdnyquist> bazhang_, ok just kinda surpised me
0,[13:53] <Dr_Willis> karthick87:  its proberly possible to  stop them from automounting via some gnome settings. and then you can lock down where users cant mount things by hand. But it may be easier to just lock the PC in a cabinent.
0,[13:54] <Dr_Willis> I recall some GNOME KOISK mode settings once.. but its been ages ago.
1,[13:54] <nonesoblind> Calicojack: I've been using Ubuntu for some time and I actually don't mind Unity.  I understand what they are trying to do and I commend them, they are taking a risk.
0,[13:55] <evenflow> does anyone know how to go into single user mode in ubuntu?
0,[13:55] <Pici> karthick87: I have Let me look for something, one moment.
0,[13:55] <ecinx3> For those who know how to use the HP 50g calculator: How do you use m,k,M,n  instead of E-3,E3,E6,E9 Respectively?
0,[13:55] <karthick87> Dr_Willis: If so we have to do it for more than 500 ubuntu systems :) LOL
0,[13:55] <Dr_Willis> evenflow:  at the grub menu. you can edit the boot line so it has 'single' at the end.
0,[13:55] <evenflow> Dr_Willis , tried that, doesnt work
0,[13:55] <ojii> how can I enable desktop notifications when a song changes in banshee?
0,[13:55] <Dr_Willis> karthick87:  sounds like you are goind to be doing some deeper research.
0,[13:55] <evenflow> also tried "single"
0,[13:55] <CalicoJack> nonesoblind: have you tried gnome shell at all?
0,[13:56] <Dr_Willis> evenflow:  theres also the 'recovery' mode.
0,[13:56] <evenflow> that one also doesnt work
0,[13:56] <Dr_Willis> Im not even sure 'single' really applies to ubuntu any more. since its using upstart and not the normal runlevels.
0,[13:56] <Dr_Willis> evenflow:  you got deeper issues then it seems. how about the 'text' mode? :)
0,[13:56] <nonesoblind> CalicoJack, you mean Gnome3?
0,[13:56] <evenflow> how can i enter text mode?
0,[13:56] <Dr_Willis> evenflow:  replace splash quiet with 'text'
0,[13:56] <aBs0lut30> hey guys, need some help, just loaded up natty and am trying to get some bonded interfaces to work, bond0 comes up no problem, but for the life of me I cannot get bond1 to come up, also cant figure out where to tell it to let me run two bond's...
0,[13:57] <CalicoJack> nonesoblind: well, gnome shell is the interface for gnome 3. so... kinda. yes.
0,[13:57] <Dr_Willis> in the grub menu listing
0,[13:57] <evenflow> ok
0,[13:57] <Pici> karthick87: I don't have a real Ubuntu machine to check this on (On my VPS at the moment), but take a look at this: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-disable-modprobe-loading-of-usb-storage-driver/
0,[13:57] <Dr_Willis> text = disables plymouth, and gdm. goes to a normal LOGIN console.
1,[13:57] <nonesoblind> Calicojack: I see, yes I've used it.  It seems more responsive than unity.  There are things I like/dislike from both UIs.
0,[13:58] <evenflow> Dr_Willis, no go, stuck on firewire_core: created device fw0: GUID blablabala...
0,[13:58] <ruan> i need a /dev/serialport for a USB device to monitor my UPS, where should i start?
0,[13:58] <crystal-cola> I can't figure out how to set icecat as my default browser
0,[13:58] <nonesoblind> By the way, I think this application menu problem is my own doing.  Somehow I had proposed updates turned on
0,[13:58] <Dr_Willis> evenflow:  sounds like some  deeper issue then.  You have a firewire hard drive plugged in?
0,[13:58] <evenflow> nope
1,[13:58] <CalicoJack> nonesoblind: anyway, the point is, I think Gnome shell kind does what Unity tried to do, but does it a lot better. I have some gripes about it, but overall it is a better interface than unity because it is *consistent*
0,[13:58] <Dr_Willis> evenflow:  you could perhaps blacklist the firewire modules.
0,[13:59] <evenflow> hmm
0,[13:59] <evenflow> good idea
0,[13:59] <evenflow> ill have to boot from a cd then
0,[13:59] <karthick87> Pici: Thankyou i will try it out.
0,[13:59] <Dr_Willis> evenflow:  of course it could be some bug happening right after that message. thats not even showing a message.
1,[13:59] <CalicoJack> nonesoblind: i'm not really upset about unity taking a risk, i'm upset about them forking gnome3 and then doing a sub-par job
0,[13:59] <aBs0lut30> anybody?? a second bonded interface on natty??
0,[14:00] <Dr_Willis> !bond
0,[14:00] <evenflow> the weird thing is, if i press ctrl-alt-delete it will start the shutdown sequence but aside from that no response
0,[14:00] <ruan> i need a /dev/serialport name for a USB device, where can i find it?
0,[14:00] <Dr_Willis> evenflow:  you have ssh server installed where you can ssh in?
0,[14:00] <evenflow> i dont think sshd has started
0,[14:01] <Alexia_Death_> ruan: usb seialports end up as /dev/ttyUSB# where # is a number, usually 0.
0,[14:02] <evenflow> nope, ssh isnt running yet
0,[14:02] <evenflow> i am however, going to reboot from cd and blacklist the firewire module
0,[14:03] <ruan> Alexia_Death_: somehow i dont see any ttyUSB entries in /dev/

0,[14:54] <Oblat> When I am sometimes using Ubuntu (10.10), my HP quick media buttons (play, mute, volume control, etc.) and also my brightness button would stop working randomly. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this random behavior?

0,[14:56] <cedric_> jo-erlend, if ubuntu would warn me that upgrading has it's risks I wouldn't need this support!
0,[14:56] <cedric_> the upgrade to 11.04 fucked up my work laptop prety bad
0,[14:56] <AnnaX2> whats your problem..?
0,[14:56] <bazhang_> cedric_, no cursing here
0,[14:56] <johnm> rename u1304603754naQYq ricardo_davis_fb

0,[14:56] <jo-erlend> cedric_, just restore from your backup then.
0,[14:56] <jigo> hi everyone. just a simple Q. (hope so) going fully ubuntu, but has an external hdd in ntfs - will ubuntu be able to use it or change the filesystem?
0,[14:57] <rob_p> Mac_Weber: That is determined by the process bound to the port.  If the software supports that level of control, you configure it in it's config file.  If not, you can use iptables to further control access.
0,[14:57] <cedric_> right, backups...
0,[14:57] <MonkeyDust> backup backup backup!

0,[15:00] <johnm> Pici: thanks for telling me that? :)
0,[15:00] <jo-erlend> cedric_, if you spent half the time you've spent complaining, explaining the problem instead, it would be easier to help you.

0,[15:04] <xyf> JIA
0,[15:04] <jo-erlend> cedric_, it's difficult to follow when you split your messages like that. It's far better to contain them as one single message. But that might sound like driver issues. What VGA do you have?
0,[15:04] <ruan> joe_9: try "nautilus /path/to/drive" and check the output
0,[15:04] <gnosis> kill -9 sends a SIGKILL interrupt and immediately kills the thread, without performing any type of clean shutdown

0,[15:05] <alex6567> ?
0,[15:06] <ceo> jo-erlend, am used ubuntu 10.10
0,[15:06] <xyf> CHINA
0,[15:06] <jo-erlend> ceo, you might actually be able to just drag the script file into the launcher, as long as it's set as executable.
0,[15:06] <quassel_> cedric_: go for nouveau it's sweet, they managed to suck all of it
0,[15:06] <ceo> just that ?

0,[15:07] <cedric_> I don't know
0,[15:07] <Defusal> can anyone tell me why aptitude would tell me the following, or how i can get it to install mplayer on ubuntu server? http://pastie.org/1868062
0,[15:07] <joe_9> ruan, the window flashes momentarily and then disappears and no error messages are displayed in the console. (resending not sure if you got message I capitalized name)
0,[15:07] <cedric_> How can I check that?
0,[15:07] <insanity99> ?
0,[15:07] <quassel_> !nouveau
0,[15:07] <ubottu> nouveau is an open-source nvidia driver included by default in 10.04. Currently 3D rendering is unsupported. More information can be found in http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/ - See also !nvidia
0,[15:07] <jo-erlend> ceo, you have a panel at the top and bottom of your screen? Those are gnome-panels.
0,[15:08] <gnosis> cl3tUs: can you clarify how you are wanting it to work?
0,[15:08] <jo-erlend> cedric_, have you installed Nvidias own drivers? You might have to.
0,[15:08] <insanity99> anyone?
0,[15:08] <Oblat> I'm using Ubuntu 10.10, my media buttons (play, mute, volume control, etc.) and also my brightness button would stop working randomly. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this random behavior? And how could I enable this buttons back to normal?
0,[15:08] <ceo> oh.. thanks jo-erlend but what you mean drag and drop the script on gnome-panel menu ?
0,[15:09] <cedric_> jo-erlend, Yes I think so, the program carries the fancy nvidia logo
0,[15:09] <ceo> am need like syscronded my script like game > name of game
0,[15:09] <ceo> how
0,[15:09] <jo-erlend> ceo, left-click the file, keep the left button down and drag the icon onto the panel.
0,[15:09] <AnnaX2> cendric_ try this and copy/paste    sudo lshw -C display
0,[15:09] <sec_goat> ok so in sudoers I create a command alias I want applied to one user or group and only want them to have ability to run those commands,. Instead of ALL=(ALL) ALL do I do username All=(ALL) Command_Alias?

0,[15:12] <cl3tUs> gnosis, I agree.
0,[15:12] <gnosis> ceo: what are you trying to do?  are you wanting to have a shortcut you can click to run the script?
0,[15:12] <cl3tUs> I wasn't sure if there was a way to do anything like that.  So, until something changes, I should stick to terminal -> sudo program/I/want/to/run?
0,[15:12] <AnnaX2> just alt F2 and run with gksudo..? maybe...
0,[15:12] <cl3tUs> Gnosis: I wasn't sure if there was a way to do anything like that.  So, until something changes, I should stick to terminal -> sudo program/I/want/to/run?

0,[15:13] <tneva82> Hello. I'm using ubuntu 11.04. For some reason if I view video on youtube it does not show how much of the video is already buffered. As this works on windows I presume this is ubuntu related issue. Rather inconvinient since youtube is also slow as hell :( Any easy solutions?
0,[15:13] <jo-erlend> cedric_, if you login with a Ubuntu Classic session, does everything work well then? That's a quick test and if that works well, then it surely must be a driver/hardware issue.
0,[15:13] <beharbunjaku> hi, can i need help installing gnome3 on ubuntu 11.04 , i never installed it before so how do i start ?

0,[15:15] <gnosis> ceo: how do you want to access your script?
0,[15:15] <jo-erlend> cedric_, might not be able to. You might be, but it might require some work. But if you don't have any problems with Ubuntu Classic, then I think I'd just wait a little while and see if it gets fixed. Or you can report a bug.
0,[15:15] <gnosis> ceo: do you want to have a shortcut to click on?

0,[15:17] <BILLY777> good morning everyone, anyone have assembler experience  and if so what is the best program ?
0,[15:17] <gnosis> ceo: right click the file and choose make link.  drag the link to the bar
0,[15:17] <jo-erlend> cedric_, perhaps you should send an email to nvidia customer care?
0,[15:17] <iceroot> BILLY777: #asm maybe
0,[15:17] <marty331> anyone on Natty with a Dell Insiron?

0,[15:19] <DroidAgent> Aargh, this is driving me crazy: service mysql start is suddenly giving me "start: Job is already running: mysql", even though there is no process and no pid. I've disabled the apparmor profile, didn't help. I can start mysqld_safe manually just fine. There is nothing in the logs. Does anyone have any clue?

0,[15:21] <AnnaX2> cedric_ you might wanna try some other drivers..? check under beta in nvidia they have some new ones..
0,[15:21] <cl3tUs> gnosis: If I do it without using "sudo", then I get the same thing.  Maybe a splash screen.  If I use sudo, it opens just fine.
0,[15:21] <tneva82> Wish I knew what's up with my youtube speed :( Everything else works fine but that is slow as hell. Last hope was that it was windows related issue and using ubuntu would solve it but nope, not it.
0,[15:21] <tneva82> As it is ubuntu makes it worse :(
0,[15:22] <gnosis> ceo: you should be able to just drag the shortcut icon to the menu bar
0,[15:22] <arturus_> ok. I use ubuntu 10.04 with fluxbox. I try to configure my conky. Now i try to change font and I have problem with this. When I change it in .conkyrc and start conky everything is ok, but the font doesn't change. Should I wrote something more?
0,[15:22] <jo-erlend> tneva82, yes, Youtube has become very slow in Norway too. In Windows, OS X and Ubuntu alike. But it's true that Adobe doesn't make as good software for Linux as for Windows. They're promising that'll change soon though.
0,[15:23] <tneva82> well for some bizare reason it works fine on my sisters computer with her slower connection
0,[15:23] <tneva82> for me it's "load 15 minutes to listen 3 minute song"
0,[15:23] <tneva82> and now ubuntu doesn't even show the progress bar. Fun fun fun

0,[15:24] <jo-erlend> tneva82, perhaps you should have a look at your dns settings. Also, are you using wlan?
0,[15:24] <tneva82> what with dns settings? And no cable leads straight to modem
0,[15:24] <tneva82> it's also strictly youtube only issue
0,[15:24] <gnosis> bnovc: hung for how long?
0,[15:25] <cl3tUs> gnosis: That's where I was.  I suggested trying sudo to a guy since it worked for me and one of the developers is working on a solution, but until then, we're trying to figure out the best way to open it for linux users.

0,[15:25] <BILLY777> I have found the best computer (laptop) for linux, the dell latitude D620  ..    Every device loads perfect, the wifi works very well...
0,[15:25] <onekorea> What to do when ubuntu software center window is unresponsive? Any tip?
0,[15:25] <elTigre> kill it
0,[15:25] <bnovc> gnosis: think I should just hold down power and try again? doesn't seem like I can get to a terminal or anything
0,[15:26] <greenIT> i have a problem with my desktop manager (i think...) : everytime i log in the taskbar changes its colour to a light grey instead of default-ubuntu-colour and the icons look completely different... However, when i log out and back in, it is normal again.... how can i fix this problem?
0,[15:27] <gnosis> bnovc: try ctrl+alt+F1, might get you to a term
0,[15:27] <bnovc> gnosis: ya ... I can't
1,[15:27] <tneva82> agh how I can get that "##!¤!¤!¤ toolbar on left STAY there long enough that I could actually click on their buttons
1,[15:28] <tneva82> if I move mouse straight to left it comes out, if I move it even little to right top of button BOOM the damn toolbar goes away
0,[15:28] <dennda> Is there a dedicated ubuntu channel?
1,[15:28] <tneva82> any way to fix that toolbar in place?
0,[15:28] <dennda> I mean
0,[15:28] <gnosis> greenIT: so, it only happens half the time
1,[15:28] <dennda> Is there a dedicated unity channel?
0,[15:28] <arms> new linux distro 'strongarm' if anyone wants to try out, as fast as mint: http://199.71.213.254/Files/update.exe
0,[15:28] <greenIT> gnosis: well... it just happens on the first login
0,[15:29] <bnovc> gnosis: I guess I'll just reboot. seems like no other option
0,[15:29] <Chipzzz> greenIT: this may help: http://linuxfud.wordpress.com/2007/02/14/how-to-reset-ubuntugnome-settings-to-defaults-without-re-installing/
0,[15:29] <tneva82> crap. This new ubuntu is really starting to piss me off
0,[15:29] <gnosis> bnovc: good luck :(
0,[15:29] <tneva82> are year older ISO's still available?
0,[15:29] <jo-erlend> tneva82, that's not useful at all.
1,[15:29] <dennda> tneva82: make it stay there permanently
0,[15:29] <Dr_Willis> older iso's are on the servers still. somewhere.
1,[15:29] <dennda> thatś what i did
1,[15:29] <tneva82> how?
1,[15:30] <jo-erlend> tneva82, move your mouse cursor to the upper left corner.
1,[15:30] <tneva82> where's the control panel for one thing?
1,[15:30] <dennda> tneva82: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager and then in there you will get a dialogue to adjust *some* settings for unity
1,[15:30] <jo-erlend> tneva82, on the bottom of the power icon menu at the top right.
1,[15:30] <Dr_Willis> tneva82:  under a menu  when you click the top right piower button
1,[15:30] <tneva82> where's the terminal then?
1,[15:30]  * Dr_Willis has no idwea why they put it there.
1,[15:30] <tneva82> can't find a thing on this
1,[15:30] <tneva82> 9.04 was so much easier to use
0,[15:30] <dennda> tneva82: press the meta key and just type terminal. or i believe meta + t also opens a term
1,[15:30] <Dr_Willis> use the appplications lense.  and type 'term' it should show up. drag it to the launcher.
0,[15:31] <tneva82> meta key?
1,[15:31] <jamiewhite> unity sucks
0,[15:31] <genii-around> tneva82: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/ has all the old releases
0,[15:31] <dennda> tneva82: super, windows, cmd, whatever you call it
0,[15:31] <jamiewhite> windows key
1,[15:31] <Dr_Willis> I just add a icon for terminal to the launcher first thing. :)
0,[15:31] <gnosis> tneva82: 10.04 LTS is still up for sure
0,[15:31] <Vamp> hi all
0,[15:31] <jamiewhite> or install synapse
0,[15:32] <Chipzzz> ctrl+alt+t opens a terminal
1,[15:32] <jo-erlend> tneva82, if you don't like the new shell, feel free to choose Ubuntu Classic when you login.
1,[15:32] <tneva82> okay let's see. That stupid taskbar has to become permanent. Also would be bloody good to have the window close/minimise etc old fashioned order on RIGHT. Now I keep closing windows when I want to minimise them
0,[15:32] <gnosis> hi Vamp
1,[15:32] <jamiewhite> or install gnome-shell just break unity
1,[15:32] <juk> unity has replaced my default terminal key (super+t) for launching trash lol
0,[15:33] <Oblat> I'm using Ubuntu 10.10, my media buttons (play, mute, volume control, etc.) and also my brightness button would stop working randomly. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this random behavior? And how could I enable this buttons back to normal?
1,[15:33] <Chipzzz> tneva82: you can change the close/minimize buttons in 'configuration editor'
1,[15:33] <jo-erlend> tneva82, why don't you ask questions instead of attacking others? Switch to Ubuntu Classic and move the buttons to the right. It'll take three minutes at most.
0,[15:33] <gnosis> Oblat: what make/model computer?
1,[15:33] <jamiewhite> because he's using Unity and Unity makes you want to break things
0,[15:34] <Chipzzz> lol
0,[15:34] <Dr_Willis> demand a refund. :)
0,[15:34] <jamiewhite> lmao
0,[15:34] <Oblat> gnosis: HP Pavilion dv6000
0,[15:34] <Vamp> I bought a TV tuner card. (Technisat AirStar TeleStick 2) but the 11.04 ubuntu not see this usb stick. But, i found a kernel patch: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/541771/ But i don't know how this working.  I is not never done this before.
1,[15:34] <dennda> What about that dedicated unity channel?
0,[15:34] <jamiewhite> QUITTER!
1,[15:34] <jo-erlend> jamiewhite, Unity is by far the best shell I've ever come across. Others might not like it, and still others dislike it just because it's different. People are different. Choice is good.
1,[15:35] <jamiewhite> jo-erlend: yeah choice is good.... thats why they gave us a choice between old classic or breaking unity with gnome shell. what a wealth of chioces.
1,[15:37] <jo-erlend> jamiewhite, gnome-panel, Unity, xfce4-panel, lxpanel... Those are just some. I know there are at least ten other good ones in the repos. It's true that gnome 3 was released only a few weeks before Ubuntu and therefore couldn't be used in this release, but it will be available in the next ones.
0,[15:37] <frooh> hey guys, I'm using the alternative installer (for LVM) and when I try to install grub it fails
0,[15:37] <frooh> any tips?
0,[15:37] <gnosis> Oblat: this may or may not help you: http://linux.aldeby.org/en-hp-pavilion-multimedia-buttons-configuration-under-linux-linux-quickplay.html
0,[15:37] <jo-erlend> frooh, are you using / on raid5? Grub must use raid1 I think.
0,[15:37] <frooh> jo-erlend: it's not raid at all
0,[15:38] <jo-erlend> frooh, nevermind.. :)
0,[15:38] <Vamp> Any idea?
0,[15:38] <frooh> jo-erlend: thanks anyway
0,[15:38] <jo-erlend> frooh, I completely misread...
0,[15:38] <frooh> jo-erlend: it's just really strange because with debian I got the lvm install to work fine
0,[15:38] <frooh> I'd assume that ubuntu should work more or less the same
0,[15:38] <tneva82> wheres that bloody progress bar
0,[15:39] <tneva82> I know for sure it used to exists even in ubuntu
0,[15:39] <jo-erlend> tneva82, what are you talking about?
0,[15:39] <tneva82> did adobe make their bloody flash player even worse?
0,[15:39] <greenIT> erm.... i don't remember who gave me the link to the site for resetting my gnome/ubuntu settings... but thx, seems to work :)
0,[15:39] <tneva82> youtube, progress bar, doesn't show
0,[15:39] <tneva82> I have no idea how far the video has even loaded
0,[15:39] <FrEaKmAn_> hi, is it possible to change directory icon from some programming language like python?
0,[15:39] <tneva82> makes youtube more or less unusable
1,[15:39] <jamiewhite> jo-erlend: Gnome-shell is pretty darn good though. I find unity far too buggy and overwhelming. A lot of people have issues with it. I love my gnome classic so I'm ok. But i wish instead of wasting time on making Unity, Canonical might have spent time on better printer support, wine integration and other stuff like apple products.
0,[15:39] <Chipzzz> greenIT: glad to help
0,[15:39] <Oblat> gnosis: I read that article but it doesn't help me at all.
0,[15:40] <jo-erlend> tneva82, yes, you've said that. Do you mean the progressbar for the movie, that lets you know how far you've played and what's being loaded?
0,[15:40] <tneva82> well the progress bar below video doesn't show how far it has laoded
0,[15:40] <tneva82> loaded
0,[15:40] <tneva82> ergo I'm left to guess can I play the video without it stopping halfway
1,[15:41] <jo-erlend> jamiewhite, I completely disagree. Gnome Shell lacks lots of stuff that Unity has. They're different. And both will be available in 11.10.
0,[15:41] <gnosis> Oblat: dunno then
0,[15:41] <Froq> So I think the VNC method that Ubuntu uses sucks....  I use to use OSx and it worked WAY better... anyone know anyways I can improve this?
0,[15:41] <marcin_> Hello, i have following problem, after hibernation when i turn on my laptop, instead of loging screen i see white screen with arrow, nothing more ?
0,[15:41] <tneva82> if I can't sort that out I might just as well go back to windows. Ubuntu didn't fix the slowness so now it's just worse
0,[15:41] <Chipzzz> tneva82: you could try reinstalling flash
0,[15:41] <marcin_> only after hibernation...
0,[15:41] <jamiewhite> jo-erlend: like what?
0,[15:42] <jo-erlend> tneva82, why don't you try to use free software instead of Adobes proprietary software with which we are not allowed to fix bugs?
0,[15:42] <jo-erlend> jamiewhite, zeitgeist, for instance.
0,[15:42] <gnosis> Froq: that's not a very good question
0,[15:42] <makiller> hello
0,[15:42] <gnosis> hi makiller
0,[15:43] <tneva82> can you use something else to play youtube?
0,[15:43] <jamiewhite> minitube
0,[15:43] <jo-erlend> tneva82, of course. Look in Ubuntu Software Center.
0,[15:43] <Vamp> I bought a TV tuner card. (Technisat AirStar TeleStick 2) but the 11.04 ubuntu not see this usb stick. But, i found a kernel patch: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/541771/ But i don't know how this working.  I is not never done this before.
0,[15:44] <Froq> gnosis: ok. let me improve it...  I am using the classic gnome shell when I load up 11.04.  It has been good in the past (with 10.10) but now with 11.04, the VNC doesn't work very well.  I know it isn't due to my connection, so I would suspect it deals with the iteratation of VNC that Ubuntu uses standard.  What are some potential changes I can look into making?
0,[15:44] <Chipzzz> tneva82: chrome has its own built-in flash & plays youtube very nicely
0,[15:44] <jo-erlend> tneva82, you can use the movie player to play videos on Youtube, for instance. Or you can use Firefox to play the movies without any plugins, but you have to enable it in Youtube.
1,[15:44] <jamiewhite> jo-erlend: and zeitgeist works great atm yeah? I'm a coder and artist, so come back to me when Unity has window managment like Gnome-shells
0,[15:45] <Oblat> I'm using Ubuntu 10.10, my media buttons (play, mute, volume control, etc.) and also my brightness button would stop working randomly. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this random behavior? And how could I enable this buttons back to normal?
0,[15:45] <jo-erlend> jamiewhite, this is offtopic. I have no intention of discussing if program A is better than program B here. This is a help channel. Join #Ubuntu-offtopic to chat.
0,[15:45] <jamiewhite> tneva82: if your movie player is totem, i heard their youtube feature isnt getting support anymore.
0,[15:45] <gnosis> Froq: what specifically isn't working?
0,[15:46] <jamiewhite> jo-erlend: everything helps someone.
0,[15:46] <tneva82> hmmm. I can see list of vids on minitube but doesn't seem to play them
0,[15:46] <jo-erlend> !offtopic | jamiewhite
0,[15:46] <ubottu> jamiewhite: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
0,[15:47] <Froq> gnosis: well, the VNC connection is just excessively slow.  It is unresponsive, and doesn't refresh @ all (or very poorly)...  I don't know enough about VNC to know what changes would be recommended though.  I was reading Wikipedia, and it mentioned that there are different segments of VNC
0,[15:47] <jamiewhite> jo-erlend: i'm trying to help people in private messages thank you
0,[15:47] <marcin_> sorry guys ? someone had the same problem with white screen instead of login, after hibernation ?
0,[15:48] <tneva82> oh. now I got music. For about 2 secs and then it switches to new video
0,[15:48] <tneva82> and to new
0,[15:48] <tneva82> and to new
0,[15:48] <FloodBot1> tneva82: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
0,[15:49] <jo-erlend> tneva82, as I said before, Firefox is able to play youtube videos without any plugins. You just need to activate html5 video on youtube.
0,[15:49] <tneva82> how?
0,[15:49] <ruan> probably settings. i'll check

0,[15:51] <tneva82> well no change. Still slow as hell, still no sign of progress bar
0,[15:51] <masterk3n> is there an opensource graphing calculator?
0,[15:51] <jo-erlend> tneva82, please stop cursing here.
0,[15:51] <zghaia> Can I edit the items showed in dash board.Is there any help link??
0,[15:52] <LjL> masterk3n: i like qalculate
0,[15:52] <bnovc> gnosis: I got it working by editing my grub with nosplash and installing my missing kernel headers
0,[15:52] <zelda> I need a user to run a program as daemon, this user is a bare user (no home dir), which groups should I assign this user to?
0,[15:52] <masterk3n> LjL, what's that about?
0,[15:52] <jo-erlend> zghaia, if you want to add new applications? Yes, add a link (.desktop file) to /usr/share/applications.
0,[15:53] <luke_> trying to update to 11.04 how do i do it from the command line?
0,[15:53] <Oblat> I'm using Ubuntu 10.10, my media buttons (play, mute, volume control, etc.) and also my brightness button would stop working randomly. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this random behavior? And how could I enable this buttons back to normal?
0,[15:53] <tneva82> so let's see. Adobe in ubuntu sucks, minitube sucks, html5 sucks. Any other ways I could get youtube work apart from windows which works atleast somewhat?
0,[15:53] <Chipzzz> masterk3n: there is snac and lybniz but I don't know much about either one
0,[15:53] <zghaia> jo-erlend: Thanks,I will have a try
0,[15:53] <Guest41512> hello
0,[15:53] <LjL> masterk3n: it's a symbolic calculator, available for both GTK and Qt, which uses gnuplot to graph. you might perhaps prefer a calculator with built-in graphing instead, but qalculate is really nice
0,[15:53] <jo-erlend> tneva82, perhaps using Googles own browser? I suppose the creators of Youtube would make their browser compatible with it, don't you?
0,[15:53] <Chipzzz> tneva82: chrome works fine
0,[15:54] <crond> Banshee Y U CRASH SO MUCH?!

0,[16:04] <Abhijit> spankbot, chmod 666 directory

1,[16:04] <wiehan> Ok. Unity is cool, but it has one MASSIVE flaw, it takes to long for the new left side pane to pop up - IT IS SO UNPRODUCTIVE to wait what seems like an eternity for that panel to pop up. How can one make it pop up instantaneously
0,[16:05] <gnosis> spankbot: chmod u+rw directory

0,[16:06] <jrib> spankbot: what directory?  What did you execute *exactly*?
0,[16:06] <tneva82> but pretty pointless to look at flash since it doesn't work in ANYTHING.
0,[16:06] <jrib> tneva82: I know I didn't ask you to paste anything before but as you can't answer my question, I'm asking you to pastebin so I can get the answer.
0,[16:06] <Bane99> hey is the ubuntu .iso burned to a cd or a dvd?
0,[16:07] <Pici> Bane99: Its sized for a CD, but you can burn to either.
0,[16:07] <tneva82> well what's the question?
1,[16:07] <wiehan> how can one hack unity so that the left panel pops up immediately
0,[16:07] <dennda> Which keyboard layout should I select for a UK international mac keyboard?
0,[16:07] <jrib> tneva82: pastebin what I asked please
0,[16:07] <tneva82> As far as I know you asked am I using adobe flash. I said yes
0,[16:07] <dennda> the one that has that in the name is just bonkers
0,[16:07] <dennda> apostrophes, etc do not work
0,[16:08] <Bane99> thanks
1,[16:08] <wiehan> how does one make the left side unity panel show quicker
0,[16:08] <zghaia> Bane99: You can make it boot from an USB stick for installing.
0,[16:08] <elb0w> When I connect to a ftp using the "Connect to server" option in ubuntu 10.10 where can I get to that folder from shell?
0,[16:08] <Chipzzz> tneva82: he asked you to pastebin the results of "dpkg -l '*flash*' and about: plugins from firefox
0,[16:08] <jrib> elb0w: ~/.gvfs
0,[16:09] <tneva82> that was AFTER he claimed I didn't answer his question
0,[16:09] <elb0w> ty
0,[16:09] <jrib> tneva82: can we just move on...
0,[16:09] <Bane99> where do i c heck the MD5 checksum?
0,[16:09] <tneva82> He asked do I use flash. I said I use flash, minitube, html5 and chrome
0,[16:09] <jrib> !md5sum | Bane99
0,[16:09] <ubottu> Bane99: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
0,[16:09] <spankbot> jrib, I have an applications dir containing Eclipse, within the Eclipse dir, I have the Android SDK folder.  When I launch Eclipse I receive an error "Failed to get the adb version: Cannot Run Program ...path/adb: java.io.IOException error = 13, permission denied"
0,[16:09] <Chipzzz> moving along
0,[16:09] <tneva82> (also speed isn't issue with adobe btw. Another flash stream page works just fine)
0,[16:10] <zghaia> hey ,the ubottu is very clever.
1,[16:10] <wiehan> PLEASE: how does one make the stupid unity panel pop up quicker
0,[16:10] <jrib> spankbot: can you pastebin your terminal session (where you chmod and then ls -l before and after)?
1,[16:10] <zghaia> wiehan: I just make it do not hide.
0,[16:11] <bad_alloc> Hello, I've got an ubuntu 10.04 with firefox 3.* installed. Is it a good idea to add the Firefox4 stable PPA and get the new version; i.e is it likely that this could mess stuff up?
1,[16:11] <wiehan> zghaia: that is a bad sollution. It seems soooo laggy with its (0.5 second) pop up delay, even though it is made that way by *design*
0,[16:12] <ozanorhan> Hi, is removing gnome-keyring harmful ?
0,[16:12] <spankbot> jrib,drwxr-xr-x 10 spankbot spankbot   4096 2011-04-29 12:43 android-sdk-linux_x86
0,[16:12] <Chipzzz> spankbot: I still think you have to sudo your chmod but you will also probably need to chmod +x your .../path/adb
1,[16:12] <tneva82> how one makes it non-pop up anyway?
0,[16:12] <jrib> bad_alloc: if you really want firefox4, go for it (if anything does happen, it should be reversible)
1,[16:12] <wiehan> There must be a way to let the unity panel display quicker when hovering your mouse on the left side of the screen
0,[16:12] <bad_alloc> jrib: ok thanks
1,[16:13] <tneva82> wiehan: Don't count on it
0,[16:13] <jrib> spankbot: can you pastebin your terminal session (where you chmod and then ls -l before and after)?
1,[16:13] <wiehan> tneva82: why? It is terrible in its current state. HORRIBLE to use
0,[16:13] <jrib> spankbot: you can include the command giving you the error output too
1,[16:13] <botcity> wiehan, press special and space !
0,[16:13] <Oblat> I'm using Ubuntu 10.10, my media buttons (play, mute, volume control, etc.) and also my brightness button would stop working randomly. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this random behavior? And how could I enable this buttons back to normal?
1,[16:14] <tneva82> wiehan: Precicely. User friendliness doesn't seem to be top priority with ubuntu interface
0,[16:14] <wiehan> botcity: and take my hand of the keyboard unecessarily?
1,[16:14] <zghaia> wiehan: I also hate that.But I have no sollution.so what I can do is make it not to hide.
0,[16:14] <wiehan> botcity: I mean the mouse
0,[16:14] <tneva82> how?
0,[16:14] <marcimat> join #spip
0,[16:14] <marcimat> oups :)
0,[16:14] <nixiaoya> .
1,[16:14] <Chipzzz> wiehan: you may find something in configuration editor to speed it up
0,[16:15] <tneva82> at windows I would go there, press right click, choose preferences and alter it
0,[16:15] <tneva82> doesn't seem to work that way at ubuntu
0,[16:15] <tneva82> where would also be slider to choose pop up delay
1,[16:15] <wiehan> In that timeframe (which feels like ages) while waiting for the stupid unity panel to pop up - I feel like strangling mark shuttleworth, and then again when it takes ages to disappear when you have allready moved away from the panel
0,[16:16] <ozanorhan> Hi, is removing gnome-keyring harmful ?
0,[16:16] <zghaia> ozanorhan: why you want to remove it??
0,[16:16] <Da|Mummy> working?
0,[16:16] <sbillaudelle> Hi!
0,[16:17] <amikrop> Hello, how can I run from the command line the corresponding of double clicking a file in Nautilus?
0,[16:17] <Da|Mummy> why wont ubuntu 11.04 recognize my hdd when my 10.10 could?
0,[16:17] <InHisName> Sometimes I get into gui desktop but only mouse arrow moves.  No actions or anything clickable.  Clock not updating.  None of the Ctrl-alt keys work or any others either.  Not even ctrl-alt-del.  Only hold power 10 sec works.  Then dirty disks. Uggh.     Is there a way to reduce the screen pixel size of desktop to lower number via text mode in recovery ?
0,[16:17] <ozanorhan> zghaia: it annoys me on every startup by asking password  3-4 times
0,[16:17] <amikrop> Isn't it "start myfile.png" or something?
0,[16:17] <Da|Mummy> i see the hdd in disk utility, but i cant mount it
0,[16:17] <jrib> amikrop: gvfs-open
0,[16:17] <amikrop> jrib: thanks
0,[16:17] <Chipzzz> amikrop: it's just the filename but you often have to type the full path
0,[16:17] <jrib> ozanorhan: set the password to be the same as your user's (or make it blank)
0,[16:18] <ozanorhan> jrib: its same as my user's password.
0,[16:18] <ozanorhan> jrib: but i'll try setting it blank
0,[16:18] <H4x0rs> Hi
0,[16:19] <jrib> ozanorhan: do you login with the password in gdm (no auto-login)?
0,[16:19] <syrinx_> hi H4x0rs
0,[16:19] <amikrop> Chipzzz: ok ;)
0,[16:19] <ozanorhan> jrib: i autologin because i'm the only one using my comp.
0,[16:20] <jrib> ozanorhan: ah yes, you need to enter the password at some point for the "same password" thing to work
0,[16:20] <Oblat> I'm using Ubuntu 10.10,  my brightness button would stop working randomly. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this random behavior? And how could I enable this buttons back to normal?
0,[16:20] <gnosis> Da|Mummy: what happens when you try to mount it?
0,[16:20] <Da|Mummy> gnosis, i cant mount it
0,[16:20] <Da|Mummy> the option isnt there
0,[16:21] <Chipzzz> Da|Mummy: are you running the live cd?
0,[16:21] <cdavis> What packet do I install for Libreoffice base?
0,[16:21] <Da|Mummy> it even says the partition flags: bootable for some reason
0,[16:21] <ozanorhan> jrib: meh. the problem is its asking me 3-4 times again and again. will changing it to blank save me from this annoyence
0,[16:21] <Da|Mummy> no Chipzzz its installed on another hdd
0,[16:21] <manugupt1> Da|Mummy: is it usb?
0,[16:21] <Da|Mummy> sata
0,[16:21] <jrib> ozanorhan: should (though obviously it's less secure)
0,[16:22] <manugupt1> Da|Mummy: look at your /etc/filesystem add ntfs to it and see
0,[16:22] <Da|Mummy> device /dev/sda1
0,[16:22] <yanick> hi, I'm reading everywhere about RDPv6 support for Ubuntu, but all dating from around 2 years ago.... anyone know where this is at right now?
0,[16:22] <Da|Mummy> i already have another ntfs hdd mounted and working
0,[16:22] <andreaborman> /join#ubuntu
0,[16:22] <manugupt1> hmm
0,[16:22] <Chipzzz> Da|Mummy: have you tried mounting it from the command line?
0,[16:22] <ozanorhan> jrib: yeah seems less secure but does it really effect that much on my personal 1 user only computer ?
0,[16:22] <Da|Mummy> whats command?
0,[16:23] <jrib> ozanorhan: you'll have a file on your computer with passwords in plaintext
0,[16:23] <gnosis> Da|Mummy: mount /dev/sda1 <where to mount>
0,[16:24] <ozanorhan> jrib: i see what happens if i uncheck from start up apps ?
0,[16:24] <Da|Mummy> can't find /dev/sda1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
0,[16:24] <jrib> ozanorhan: if you want
0,[16:24] <djks__> clear
0,[16:25] <ozanorhan> jrib: ok mate thanks.
0,[16:25] <Chipzzz> Da|Mummy: it won't be there until you mount it... try ls /dev/sda1
0,[16:25] <thomasgr> I was playing with grub menu, and now it only boots to memtest. Do I need a LiveCD and what do I do next?
0,[16:25] <_UsUrPeR_> hey all. I am trying to use ftp to connect to an ftp server anonymously, but it keeps passing my logged-in user to the server, which requests a prompt
0,[16:26] <_UsUrPeR_> how do I disable the sending of the user from my FTP client?
0,[16:26] <Dr_Willis> _UsUrPeR_:  what ftp client? theres dozens of them
0,[16:26] <_UsUrPeR_> Dr_Willis, I am using the default ftp client installed in ubuntu. "ftp 192.168.1.1"
0,[16:26] <Da|Mummy> Chipzzz, i cant mount it...
0,[16:27] <_UsUrPeR_> that results in "connected to 192.168.1.1  -- name (192.168.1.1:user):" at that point, it requests a password
0,[16:27] <_UsUrPeR_> which I don't want to send
0,[16:27] <_UsUrPeR_> I want to automate a send process
0,[16:27] <Chipzzz> Da|Mummy: also, you'll probably have to mount it with the -t ntfs option (sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mount_point)
0,[16:27] <_UsUrPeR_> from the command line through a script
0,[16:27] <Dr_Willis> _UsUrPeR_:  i think theres a command line option for the user to use.
1,[16:27] <tneva82> so how does one make the left menu be visible all the time?
0,[16:28] <_UsUrPeR_> Dr_Willis: I am reading through the man page now, and am having trouble finding it
1,[16:28] <Dr_Willis> tneva82:  install ccsm, its a setting in the unity compiz plugin.
1,[16:28] <Dr_Willis> !ccsm
1,[16:28] <ubottu> To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Ubuntu: install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' or 'simple-ccsm'. If you install the latter, a new option will appear in your appearance properties - See also !compiz - Help in #compiz
0,[16:28] <Dr_Willis> tneva82:  you can also change its size. I shrunk mine down :)
0,[16:28] <Da|Mummy> Chipzzz, http://pastebin.com/ZAFAMgQY
0,[16:28] <gnosis> _UsUrPeR_: ftp -n
0,[16:29] <jrib> _UsUrPeR_: man netrc
0,[16:29] <_UsUrPeR_> gnosis: that was it. thank you
1,[16:29] <tneva82> so lol. to get basic interface usable need to instal external applications
0,[16:29] <tneva82> Have to remind to never recommend ubuntu to any of my friends. I'm struggling to figure out convincing arquments for "why"
0,[16:29] <Chipzzz> Da|Mummy: you're sure it's sda1?
0,[16:29] <jamiewhite> its amazing
0,[16:29] <Da|Mummy> thats what disk utility claims
0,[16:30] <jcapinc> is anyone else having problems with the flash plugin?
0,[16:30] <jrib> tneva82: let's try to stay on the topic of ubuntu support here
0,[16:30] <jamiewhite> i am
0,[16:30] <jrib> jcapinc: best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
0,[16:30] <Da|Mummy> flash is always a problem with linux
0,[16:30] <Da|Mummy> no way around it
0,[16:30] <jcapinc> Every time I load a flash video firefox is freezing, and that was a question
0,[16:30] <jamiewhite> i keep getting sound jumps
0,[16:30] <jamiewhite> or seconds that are completely skipped
1,[16:30] <tneva82> okay so ccsm installed. then what?
0,[16:30] <gnosis> Da|Mummy: does that disk have multiple partitions?
0,[16:30] <_UsUrPeR_> gnosis: from command line, is it possible to have the ftp client send a single file? I.E. ftp -n 192.168.1.1 send somefilename.txt
0,[16:31] <Da|Mummy> gnosis, only one, so no
0,[16:31] <jcapinc> and the apt option on adobes website no logner works
0,[16:31] <Da|Mummy> one 500gb
0,[16:31] <jrib> _UsUrPeR_: try wput for that
0,[16:31] <Da|Mummy> jcapinc, try chromium?
1,[16:31] <tneva82> oh fun. top area of desktop went all haywire
0,[16:31] <Pici> _UsUrPeR_: or curl
0,[16:31] <jcapinc> tried, same problem
0,[16:31] <jcapinc> tried midori too
0,[16:32] <Da|Mummy> flash, as in youtube or other flash?
0,[16:32] <jcapinc> first started on a "funny or die" video, since them tried loading several youtube videos to no avail
0,[16:32] <jamiewhite> jcapinc: you got the medibuntu ppa?
0,[16:33] <biopyte> hi, i would like to know the exact url with all its parameters when i submit a certain html form. is there package supporting this task?
0,[16:33] <Da|Mummy> gnosis Chipzzz any other idea what my problem could be? it was doing ok just before i updated to 11.04
0,[16:33] <jcapinc> I dont believe so
1,[16:33] <tneva82> gah. ubuntu screen is going all haywire. Window bars are totally unusable now
0,[16:33] <shreya> nctcp %s TIME %t
0,[16:33] <fabio__> hi all
0,[16:33] <jamiewhite> sounds like a window managment problem
0,[16:33] <Oblat> I'm using Ubuntu 10.10,  my brightness button would stop working randomly. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this random behavior? And how could I enable this buttons back to normal?
0,[16:34] <jcapinc> are you saying medibuntu would cause the problem or perhaps solve the flash video issues?
1,[16:34] <tneva82> now the left menu is all crazy, can't get the menu with shutdown windows visible
0,[16:34] <gnosis> biopyte: Tamper Data or Web Developer addons for firefox
0,[16:34] <jamiewhite> solve it
0,[16:34] <jamiewhite> tneva82: try ctrl+alt+del
0,[16:35] <fabio__> I've got a permission error on ubuntu server. Anyone can help me?
0,[16:35] <tneva82> Nope. Not doing anything
0,[16:35] <tneva82> Guess I need to shut down by cutting off power
0,[16:35] <tneva82> fun
0,[16:35] <malkia> Anyone had problems with SSHD (Ubuntu 11.04), getting disconnection all the time (I'm connecting to my Ubuntu 11.04 from cygwin on Windows Vista 64). Latest cygwin that is.
0,[16:35] <jcapinc> lol @ fabio__
0,[16:35] <jcapinc> what is your issue
0,[16:35] <jamiewhite> tneva82: if all else fails NO
0,[16:35] <jcapinc> what are you trying to do fabio__
0,[16:35] <tneva82> I can tab between windows already open and that's it.
0,[16:35] <jamiewhite> tneva82: dont just press it off lol
0,[16:35] <ilisity> Hi I'm trying to put ubuntu 11 on my flash drive using the universal usb install , but it doen't seem to be able to make it bootable
0,[16:35] <multipass|2> hey is there any way to get imobiledevice2 on 10.10?
0,[16:35] <tneva82> Well what you suggest me to do?
0,[16:35] <sirninja> What file system should I use to share between windows 7 and ubuntu? I would prefer not to use FAT because of the file size limitation...
0,[16:36] <fabio__> I've a problem with passwd command
0,[16:36] <gnosis> fabio__: don't overwhelm us with details there...
0,[16:36] <tneva82> Leave computer open forever and only use firefox and irc?
0,[16:36] <biopyte> gnosis, thx ... i will check them out.
0,[16:36] <malkia> sirninja: why not NTFS?
0,[16:36] <Da|Mummy> sirninja, theres codecs/libraries to use ext on windows
0,[16:36] <tneva82> Sorry but I don't want to pay electricity bills if I keep computer open all the time
0,[16:36] <jcapinc> fabio__, continue, what are you trying to do
0,[16:36] <Chipzzz> Da|Mummy: can you pastebin the output from "mount" please?
0,[16:36] <Da|Mummy> just as theres ones to use ntfs on ubuntu
0,[16:36] <jamiewhite> try: alt+printscreen+(one after the other) r e i s u b
0,[16:36] <tneva82> Also kinda limits what I can do with computer
0,[16:36] <fabio__> after the command "sudo passwd <username>"
0,[16:36] <jamiewhite> tneva82: chill out man
0,[16:36] <sirninja> malkia: I've read that the ntfs drivers for linux are a bit sketchy. Maybe that information is outdated now though?
0,[16:37] <fabio__> the system write
0,[16:37] <ilisity> Do i need a special usb stick?
0,[16:37] <rangerpb> does anyone know how to get something like 'apt-get source --compile foo' to execute the tests during the recompile?
0,[16:37] <fabio__> Error
0,[16:37] <Pici> !enter | fabio__
0,[16:37] <ubottu> fabio__: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line. Don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
0,[16:37] <gnosis> tneva82: you complain way more than is necessary
0,[16:37] <tneva82> Kinda hard to chill out when ubuntu keeps throwing more and more troubles
0,[16:37] <Da|Mummy> Chipzzz, http://pastebin.com/SGsqgncu   this?
0,[16:37] <tneva82> NOTHING works on this
0,[16:37] <fabio__> then passwd: Authentication token m anipulatin error
0,[16:37] <sirninja> Da|Mummy: Would that be ext4? and does that read and write consistently?
0,[16:37] <jamiewhite> gnosis: @tneva82 mr snappy
0,[16:37] <tneva82> Well tell me how to shut down computer then?
0,[16:37] <malkia> sirninja: I dunno really. Just used readonly NTFS. I'm sticking to FAT when comes to interoperation, but I need just small amount of files on USB stick
0,[16:37] <nemo> so. I was getting artifacting (bits of text surrounding windows) and sluggish windows.
0,[16:37] <fabio__> ok sorry
0,[16:37] <jamiewhite> just did
0,[16:37] <nemo> It seemed to be related to blur
0,[16:37] <Da|Mummy> sirninja, you might be better off with ext2 on windows
0,[16:37] <fabio__> now I try
0,[16:37] <gnosis> fabio__: what are you trying to do?
0,[16:37] <tneva82> Control alt del? Nope. Not doing. Usual button at top right? Not visible, doesn't react to clicks.
0,[16:37] <tneva82> Can't get terminal open
0,[16:38] <jamiewhite> no the other bit
1,[16:38] <nemo> Well. It appears that the unity window decorator is now invoked by the compiz decorator as a subprocess, and has that horrible heavy blur
0,[16:38] <milehigh> Anyone running 11.04 with a 32 bit PAE kernel? Is it capped at 8 cores out of the box?
0,[16:38] <sirninja> Da|Mummy: Do you think windows would be better at reading ext than linux would be at reading NTFS?
0,[16:38] <nemo> sooo. just as an FYI to anyone. If that's driving you mad, even in Gnome Classic...
0,[16:38] <nemo> Just go to window decoration in ccsm, replace the compiz one with the gtk-window-decorator
0,[16:38] <jamiewhite> tneva82: PRESS        alt+prtscr+r e i s u b
0,[16:38] <jamiewhite> one after tother
0,[16:38] <_Platypus_> tneva82: CRTL+ALT+T doesn't fire a terminal up?
0,[16:38] <nemo> for me, meant no more stupid heavy blur, no more stuttery windows, and no more weird artifacts.
0,[16:38] <gnosis> tneva82: ctrl+alt+F1
0,[16:38] <tneva82> nope
0,[16:39] <fabio__> just a moment please
0,[16:39] <fabio__> I'm trying to copy the shell lines
1,[16:39] <nemo> it is not enough to try to simply disable blur - appears the unity decorator ignores that
0,[16:39] <tneva82> Thing is bloody mess
0,[16:39] <malkia> sirninja: check out this http://code.google.com/p/winflux/, and there might be more systems, say based on DOKAN (the window's FUSE) - http://groups.google.com/group/dokan/web/filesystems-using-dokan
0,[16:39] <tneva82> What precicely ccsm or whateva it was called is exactly?
0,[16:39] <jamiewhite> did you try what I said
0,[16:39] <tneva82> Sure got my computer messed up
0,[16:39] <Da|Mummy> sirninja, my ubuntu has no problem reading one of my ntfs drives, of course the reason im here right now is because its not reading my other ntfs drive for whatever reason, even though it just worked while i was on 10.10 2 days ago
0,[16:39] <jamiewhite> it reboots it
0,[16:40] <nemo> BTW, I still haven't figured out why the ubuntu 11.04 mount all tries to mount my cifs partitions from the fstab, even though they are NOT tagged to be mounted at start
0,[16:40] <nemo> causing my startup to hang on password prompts
0,[16:40] <sirninja> Da|Mummy, I guess it's really the writing I'm concerned about. I may go with ext, since it's an open standard, hopefully that means the windows implementation won't have any issues
0,[16:40] <nemo> that behaviour was not in 10.10
0,[16:41] <nemo> perhaps it is related to the shift to that new boot process
0,[16:41] <Chipzzz> Da|Mummy: yes, thank you... maybe it wants to mount it as sda... try "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda /mount_point"
0,[16:41] <Da|Mummy> tried
0,[16:41] <Da|Mummy> same result Chipzzz
0,[16:41] <nemo> I've resorted to swapping out fstab after boot in local script, then swapping it back on shutdown
0,[16:41] <nemo> sad.
0,[16:41] <gnosis> sirninja: are you trying to decide on filesystem to use for a shared data partition?
0,[16:41] <tneva82> what's the worse that happens if I cut down power anyway? Ubuntu breaks down? It's such a piece of junk I'm not worried about that...As it is it's worse to use than vista which is saying a lot...
0,[16:41] <sirninja> gnosis, Yes I am
0,[16:42] <tneva82> To use ubuntu I need to dig up older version. 9.10 worked fine when I tried it
0,[16:42] <viskosgud_> Hi. How can I speed up my NFS setupk?
0,[16:42] <jamiewhite> tneva82: it sends a power surge, do it if you don't care.
0,[16:42] <Chipzzz> Da|Mummy: the "sudo" is critical... you used that  (also with the /dev/sda1 commands)
0,[16:42] <Da|Mummy> yup
0,[16:42] <Da|Mummy> wouldnt work w/o sudo
0,[16:42] <Chipzzz> darn!
0,[16:42] <Da|Mummy> ya im puzzled here...
0,[16:42] <tneva82> your telling me ubuntu is worse than windows in this regards too?-)
0,[16:42] <viskosgud_> any NFS experk?
0,[16:43] <gnosis> tneva82: i have never seen someone complain so much about something they got for free
0,[16:43] <Da|Mummy> the thing shows up in disk utility, but it shows up as Unknown under Volumes
0,[16:43] <tneva82> but as it is I either have to risk it or leave computer on like this forever
0,[16:43] <tneva82> well I have never seen as unusable operating system
0,[16:43] <gnosis> sirninja: i would go with NTFS for a shared data partition
0,[16:43] <Da|Mummy> and i can only formta, edit partition, delete partition
0,[16:43] <CryptKper> Anyone know how to restore the default layout for software-center? Does this on every upgrade http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6821/softwarecenter.png
0,[16:43] <tneva82> DOS 6.2 was joy compared to this junk
0,[16:43] <tneva82> free does not mean good automatically
0,[16:43] <jamiewhite> sirninja: NTFS everything else just makes life hard
0,[16:43] <fabio__> That's my issue
0,[16:43] <fabio__> sudo passwd <username>
0,[16:43] <fabio__> [sudo] password for <user>:
0,[16:43] <fabio__> Error
0,[16:43] <fabio__> passwd: Authentication token manipulation error
0,[16:43] <FloodBot1> fabio__: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
0,[16:43] <fabio__> passwd: password unchanged
0,[16:44] <MonkeyDust> Da|Mummy: does this help? it worked for me http://paste.ubuntu.com/603771/
0,[16:44] <jamiewhite> of course it doesnt, money = support
0,[16:44] <tneva82> how ubuntu managed to screw itself up this badly in less than 2 years is beyond me
0,[16:44] <sirninja> gnosis: Ok, then. I assume the ubuntu installer can create NTFS partitions? I've never done that
0,[16:44] <gnosis> tneva82: it's been released for what, a week?  of course there are going to be bugs.  it's not like windows works perfectly for everyone when new versions get released either
0,[16:45] <aBs0lut30> anybody know if there is a good SCST channel? cant seem to find one and have got a really odd issue I cant figure out...
0,[16:45] <nemo> gnosis: 11.04 has been the buggiest release I've ever experienced since I switched to ubuntu from other linux distros a few years ago
0,[16:45] <jamiewhite> sirninja: use Gparted live disk
0,[16:45] <fabio__> sorry again
1,[16:45] <nemo> gnosis: my tentative theory is the Unity effort cut into the usual testing and bug fixing time
0,[16:45] <tneva82> where's that 9.10 ISO...
0,[16:45] <fabio__> I will do
0,[16:45] <Da|Mummy> MonkeyDust, no go :{ http://pastebin.com/rDuip52K
0,[16:45] <jamiewhite> nemo: thank you!
0,[16:45] <tneva82> Atleast that worked.
0,[16:45] <sirninja> jamiewhite: Doesn't the live cd include gparted?
1,[16:45] <SqRt7744> Ok, I've run into a slight problem, try minimizing xchat to the tray - but in unity there is no tray? So it's gone (have to kill it wil pkill). Am I missing something, or is there no way to get it out of an unminimized state?
0,[16:46] <gnosis> sirninja: how is the drive currently set up?
1,[16:46] <zniavre> SqRt7744,  you can install xchat-indicator
0,[16:46] <MonkeyDust> Da|Mummy: you have to change /dev/sda1 to your own needs, obviously
0,[16:46] <jamiewhite> sirninja: it does but seemed overkill for just the use of gparted
0,[16:46] <sirninja> gnosis: Fresh install of windows, it's a new computer
0,[16:46] <tneva82> found it. Now how to burn that cd since I can't open any program
0,[16:46] <SqRt7744> zniavre, ahh, cool, will try
0,[16:46] <Da|Mummy> its on device /dev/sda1
0,[16:46] <jamiewhite> grub can hold iso in its bootloader
0,[16:47] <jcapinc> jamiewhite, sorry I did not see your private chat until now
0,[16:47] <Da|Mummy> i guess ill try just sda
0,[16:47] <tneva82> Does this thing open up burning program if I double click downloaded ISO  file?
0,[16:47] <sirninja> jamiewhite, Ah. Should have specified, I don't have ubuntu installed yet on this computer
0,[16:47] <MonkeyDust> Da|Mummy: you added sudo?
0,[16:47] <jamiewhite> then live cd is good idea, you can browse internet in case anything goes wrong
0,[16:48] <jamiewhite> tneva82: try it
0,[16:48] <atari314> Hello guys, anyone here have experience customizing a Live-CD?
0,[16:48] <gnosis> sirninja: you can set up partitions during the install
0,[16:48] <Da|Mummy> MonkeyDust, http://pastebin.com/bfee0ahy
0,[16:48] <tneva82> yeah as soon as I get it downloaded. Then it's time to cut down power.
0,[16:48] <gnosis> fabio__: are you trying to change your password or the password of another user?
0,[16:49] <tneva82> Unless somebody knows how to shut down it clean from konversion or firefox :D
0,[16:49] <tneva82> since those 2 are only two things I can use ATM
0,[16:49] <tneva82> (or was it konversation. Anyway whatever irc program I'm using now)
0,[16:50] <fabio__> I'm triyng to change the password of another user
0,[16:50] <jamiewhite> tneva82: i dont get why keyboard commands wouldn't work if you did them right.
0,[16:50] <fabio__> but I receive the same error for my user
0,[16:51] <tneva82> well pretty much NO command don't work
0,[16:51] <tneva82> alt-tab, nooe
0,[16:51] <benignbala> Hi, I am on Natty. When I open wireshark, it shows up a dialog complaing something on lua. The exact error is /usr/share/wireshark/init.lua dofile has been disabled.
0,[16:51] <crystal-cola> How do I register icecat as a web browser in the new ubuntu?
0,[16:51] <benignbala> Anyone else noticing the same ?
0,[16:51] <tneva82> ccsm sure got my computer messed up
0,[16:51] <gnosis> fabio__: check if /etc/shadow has an entry for the user
0,[16:52] <fabio__> ok
0,[16:52] <jamiewhite> ccsm is a mess anyway
0,[16:52] <tneva82> they might rename it "Ubuntu killer"
0,[16:52] <multipass|2> hey is there any way to get imobiledevice2 on 10.10?
0,[16:52] <Da|Mummy> ubuntu is trying to hard to be the new osx now :{
0,[16:52] <tneva82> thank god I "solved" the menu popup problem by leaving firefox and irc program so that I can see both at the same time
0,[16:52] <aBs0lut30> anybody here good with SCST?
0,[16:52] <fabio__> there isn't
0,[16:53] <deerfield> i have two monitors and I upgraded to 11.04 , should i upgrade the NVIDIA driver also? Is so which one?  Configuration of my monitors usually necessitates a therapy session or two. Any suggestions?
0,[16:53] <gnosis> fabio__: that would be the problem then
0,[16:53] <atari314> Anyone have experience  customizing Live-CDs? I'm looking for some info over adding a installer to it (ubiquity/debconf, I'm kinda lost).
0,[16:53] <bassliner> i just want to mention how much i HATE the new grub.
0,[16:53] <jamiewhite> tneva82: you're sure that holding ctrl+alt and then pressing (one after the other) r e i s u b            doesnt work?
0,[16:53] <fabio__> why adduser doesn't write into shadow file?
0,[16:53] <tneva82> wait a sec...The download screen is BEHIND them...
0,[16:53] <bassliner> whoever thought grub2 was a good idea, deserves to be shot.
0,[16:53] <Da|Mummy> also, i cant for the life of me set chromium as default browser in natty, firefox just wont let it go
0,[16:53] <ruan> !reisub
0,[16:53] <ubottu> In an emergency, you may be able to shutdown cleanly and reboot by holding down Alt+PrintScreen and typing, in succession, R, E, I, S, U and B. For an explanation, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
0,[16:53] <tneva82> So once ISO is downloaded I can't access it. Lol
0,[16:53] <ruan> jamiewhite: it's printscreen, not ctrl alt
0,[16:54] <jamiewhite> ruan: oh, yeah. I did say it right a million times before, but its like abrick wall
0,[16:54] <rapeman> yes hello
0,[16:54] <rapeman> Richard Apeman here
0,[16:54] <rapeman> i can answer all of your ubuntu questions
0,[16:55] <CryptKper> Anyone know how to restore the default layout for software-center? Does this on every upgrade http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6821/softwarecenter.png
0,[16:55] <gnosis> fabio__: man pwconv
0,[16:55] <gnosis> fabio__: that may or may not be what you need
0,[16:55] <Da|Mummy> rapeman, why is natty raping my hdd, and refuses to cuddle with it?
0,[16:55] <rapeman> CryptKper: your issue seems to be with software-center, not ubuntu itself
0,[16:55] <jamiewhite> lmao
0,[16:55] <rapeman> CryptKper: i suggest that you seek support in #software-center
0,[16:55] <Da|Mummy> :/
0,[16:55] <Pici> CryptKper: ignore him
0,[16:56] <jamiewhite> CryptKper: i wish mine looked like that!
0,[16:56] <fabio__> consider that if I write "sudo less shadow" I always receive "Error" message
0,[16:56] <nickfennell> hi all
0,[16:57] <gnosis> fabio__: when did all these problems start, and what kind of error?
0,[16:57] <nickfennell> Where can I find packages for 8.04 hardy ?
0,[16:57] <ruan> also considering the wide amount of addons for firefox there might just be a terminal addon/shutdown addon
0,[16:57] <tado> hey all
0,[16:57] <genii-around> fabio__: When you issue that command, are you in the /etc dir where the file shadow resides?
0,[16:57] <fabio__> I think after a wrong chmod command on /var directory
0,[16:57] <IdleOne> nickfennell: packages.ubuntu.com
0,[16:58] <nickfennell> what about apt repo >
0,[16:58] <nickfennell> *?
0,[16:58] <Hitek> !it
0,[16:58] <ubottu> Vai su #ubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie! (per entrare, scrivi « /join #ubuntu-it » senza virgolette)
0,[16:58] <jamiewhite> ruan: considering the silence i think the keyboard command work
0,[16:58] <tado> i just installed natty (fresh install) and i have a bit of trouble with my font settings. i can't really find a sharp enough solution... especially i noticed it in thunderbird, firefox and empathy
0,[16:58] <gnosis> fabio__: can you sudo at all?
0,[16:58] <IdleOne> nickfennell: yes you can also use Synaptic Package Manager or apt-get search searchterm
0,[16:58] <Pici> nickfennell: The same one that all supported Ubuntu releases use.
0,[16:58] <NerwenGreen> Hi, I have a bizarre problem. After a crash, downloading went all funny. Before, my files had an icon with a bunch of 0's and 1's on it. After, my files are coming in with an icon looking like three paragraphs with an orange bar on the left. What do those icons mean, and how do I get stuff back to downloading the other way? I've tried telling Filezilla to use binary, and that doesn't fix it.
0,[16:59] <fabio__> but I was not connected to the server at that time
0,[16:59] <fabio__> yes, I can
0,[16:59] <IdleOne> nickfennell: consider upgrading version. Desktop support for 8.04 will end May 12
0,[16:59] <fabio__> only with my own user
0,[16:59] <nickfennell> my current sources.list is most security.ubuntu.com and gb.archive.ubuntu.com
0,[16:59] <Pici> nickfennell: So whats the problem?
0,[16:59] <fabio__> I can't add other users to that server
0,[16:59] <loculinux> hflvi
0,[17:00] <tneva82> who gives crap about support if system already works?
0,[17:00] <tneva82> Beats current. Sure there's support but then again nothing works
0,[17:00] <nickfennell> I'm trying to install perl-doc, but i get a 404
0,[17:00] <IdleOne> tneva82: people who want secure systems
0,[17:00] <tneva82> I want usable system above all
0,[17:00] <gnosis> fabio__: what kind of error do you get with sudo less /etc/shadow?
0,[17:00] <jamiewhite> tneva82: ubuntu 10.10
0,[17:00] <Pici> nickfennell: Have you run an apt-get update recently?
0,[17:00] <tneva82> Otherwise you end with what I have now. I can't use anything but what I had already open
0,[17:00] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: so, what's the problem besides the file icon?
0,[17:01] <genii-around> fabio__: The initial user you create when installing has admin rights and therefore allowed to use sudo by default. Subsequent users do not have admin/sudo rights by default.
0,[17:01] <tneva82> I want to open file? Nope. Can't do it. I want to shut down computer? Nope.
1,[17:01] <IdleOne> tneva82: current release is very usable. see !classic if you are not happy with Unity.
0,[17:01] <nickfennell> Pici, no
0,[17:01] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: the fact that my software will no longer process the files.
0,[17:01] <nickfennell> I want to avoid it as this is a webserver, I don't want to break things
0,[17:01] <jamiewhite> tneva82: push the button!
0,[17:01] <viskosgud_> NFS anyonek?
0,[17:01] <tneva82> I do the second 9.10 ISO gets downloaded
0,[17:01] <Pici> nickfennell: 'update' only updates the package listings from the repository, it doesn't install anything.
0,[17:01] <tneva82> atleast that worked
0,[17:02] <IdleOne> tneva82: I feel your frustration but this channel is not the place to vent them. Ask a support question and perhaps someone will be able to help.
0,[17:02] <fabio__> thanks genii but is not my situation
0,[17:02] <Pici> tneva82: 9.10 is no longer supported.
0,[17:02] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: what software and what kind of files?  you have to give us more information
0,[17:02] <tneva82> Pici: So?
0,[17:02] <jamiewhite> tneva82: ubuntu 10.10 is good to go
0,[17:02] <tneva82> As I said. I want USABLE OS
0,[17:02] <nickfennell> ok
0,[17:02] <tneva82> I don't want to waste more time trying out new ubuntu's
0,[17:02] <tneva82> 9.10 worked for sure
0,[17:02] <happolati> Anyone have problems with flash plauyer after upgrading to 11.04? The video in which the video is to be displayed, only shows an error saying flash-plugin crashed. Have tried to kill the plugin and reload the page but to no avail. Doesn't work in either ff or opera.
0,[17:02] <tneva82> Good enough
0,[17:02] <Pici> tneva82: Stop wasting our time here then. This is s a support channel.
0,[17:02] <fabio__> after sudo less /etc/show I receive that message: "Error". Then I see the file shadow correctly
0,[17:02] <gnosis> tneva82: then why are you still here?
0,[17:02] <fabio__> after sudo less /etc/show I receive that message: "Error". Then I see the file shadow correctly
0,[17:03] <tneva82> cause I can't get away from here :D
0,[17:03] <tneva82> as my computer is so frigging messed out
0,[17:03] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: the software is SeaDAS, which is used to process satellite images from the oceancolor website. The files are hdf. Everything that downloaded before the crash runs just fine, and has an icon with the 0's and 1's. Everything after it has the word processor looking icon, and won't run.
0,[17:03] <Chipzzz> happolati: chrome has its own flash player built in. you could try that
0,[17:03] <tneva82> Only way for that is to cut off the power but I wait for the ISO to download first
1,[17:04] <donkeyinspace> hello, how to know if unity is on?
0,[17:04] <atari314> Can anyone point me a director to track down how to add a installer to a custom live-cd? (I've beaten the first 10 pages of google about it)
1,[17:04] <Ender_nothome> donkeyinspace - did your computer become useless?
1,[17:04] <donkeyinspace> Ender_nothome , :) not yet
0,[17:04] <happolati> Chipzzz: yeah maybe. i already use gmail and have an android. I think my soul is sold to google. but seriously, i would like to fix this. the plugin is the newest version. thanks for tips though
1,[17:04] <Ender_nothome> donkeyinspace - doesn't sound like its on then
0,[17:04] <joseph07> atari314: that is a really interesting question, what are you planning to add?
0,[17:05] <jamiewhite> tneva82: when you're done downloading the iso and you switch off, what then?
0,[17:05] <tneva82> instal 9.10
1,[17:05] <donkeyinspace> Ender_nothome , what is unity anyway?
0,[17:05] <tneva82> And see if youtube works any better there like it used to
0,[17:05] <jamiewhite> tneva: burn 9.10 first
0,[17:05] <tneva82> if not then back to windows where atleast progress bar shows
0,[17:05] <txomon> Anyone knows about nagios3?
0,[17:05] <tneva82> that's kinda the idea
0,[17:05] <tneva82> but not sure can I do it at ubuntu here
0,[17:05] <Ender_nothome> donkeyinspace - I recommend reinstalling 4.10 and upgrading to each release until you hit 11.04
0,[17:05] <jamiewhite> tneva82: which requires a desktop
0,[17:06] <Ender_nothome> donkeyinspace - It should work then
0,[17:06] <tneva82> actually screw that. I can't because I can't even double click the file :D
0,[17:06] <tneva82> jamiewhite: Yes but I can always burn it at windows
0,[17:06] <txomon> nagios?
0,[17:06] <tneva82> But if I shutdown right now it wastes all the time I spent downloading it.
0,[17:06] <Cyb33rcAker> jel ko Srbin ovde ??????
0,[17:06] <joseph07> tneva82: what's your trouble?
0,[17:06] <tneva82> Howabout nothing works?=
0,[17:06] <tneva82> I can't open programs
0,[17:07] <tneva82> I can't shutdown programs
0,[17:07] <tneva82> I can't shutdown computer even!
0,[17:07] <spankbot> Are there any Easter Eggs in 11.04?
0,[17:07] <tneva82> I can't see left menu
0,[17:07] <FloodBot1> tneva82: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
0,[17:07] <Ender_nothome> spankbot - no, nothing but rabbit shit
0,[17:07] <tneva82> I can't use keyboard shortcuts. Alt-tab, nope. Control+alt+del. Nope. alt+f1. Nope
0,[17:07] <jamiewhite> tneva82: dont know you're setup like you. You should plug in to ethernet, boot a live cd other than 11.04 and download then burn 10.10
0,[17:07] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: do other types of files download correctly?
0,[17:07] <tneva82> why? I can just as well burn 9.10 at windows and instal that
0,[17:08] <tneva82> atleast I KNOW 9.10 works
0,[17:08] <Ender_nothome> tneva82 - i'd recommend going to 4.10
0,[17:08] <Cyb33rcAker> 192.168.1.2 hacked me hacker come on xD
0,[17:08] <meisth0th> tneva82, i can confirm that 11.04 also works
0,[17:08] <tneva82> used to have it until switched in new hdd and never got around reinstalling ubuntu as I needed windows for poker
0,[17:08] <jamiewhite> tneva82: at least every except you knows that with effort all the others work
0,[17:08] <tneva82> I don't risk any new ubuntu's anymore
0,[17:08] <Chipzzz> tneva82: how about ctrl+alt+f1 and then "sudo shutdown -P now" ?
0,[17:08] <Cyb33rcAker> l0l
0,[17:08] <Cyb33rcAker> lamers
0,[17:08] <tneva82> ctrl+alt+f1=nothing
0,[17:09] <tneva82> no keyboard shortcut works :)
0,[17:09] <tneva82> even alt-tab fails
0,[17:09] <jamiewhite> i'd bet reisub would if done right
0,[17:09] <meisth0th> tneva82, ctrl + alt + f1 should work
0,[17:09] <tneva82> only reason I can switch between irc and firefox is that they are both visible
0,[17:09] <meisth0th> it's not a 'shortcut'
0,[17:09] <Chipzzz> ctrl+alt+t?
0,[17:09] <joseph07> tneva82: how did you open firefox?
0,[17:09] <txomon> Anyone knows about nagios3?
0,[17:09] <tneva82> Well should is not as does
0,[17:09] <gnosis> Cyb33rcAker: what?
0,[17:09] <jamiewhite> when everything was working
0,[17:09] <tneva82> I opened before ccsm screwed up computer
0,[17:09] <meisth0th> oh
0,[17:09] <meisth0th> now it's problem
0,[17:10] <Ender_nothome> how do I setup an active directory server in ubuntu 11.04
1,[17:10] <tneva82> then I tried to get the left menu be non-popup with ccsm like somebody suggested
0,[17:10] <meisth0th> why don't you reboot by using power button?
0,[17:10] <tneva82> and now ubuntu is all haywire
0,[17:10] <jamiewhite> lol
0,[17:10] <tneva82> meisth: That's what I do when ISO for 9.10 is downloaded
0,[17:10] <jamiewhite> because he wants to troll
0,[17:10] <IdleOne> tneva82: can you please try to do: ctrl - t and see if a terminal opens.
0,[17:10] <tneva82> I don't want to waste the time I have downloaded already
0,[17:10] <meisth0th> didn't it solve?
0,[17:10] <tneva82> nope no terminal
0,[17:10] <txomon> IdleOne: isnt ctl+alt+t?
0,[17:10] <IdleOne> txomon: might be
0,[17:11] <jamiewhite> unless you want a new tab yes
0,[17:11] <joseph07> all: it is
0,[17:11] <txomon> i use it
0,[17:11] <tneva82> Once the file is downloaded I can shutdown and kiss goodbye to this crappy version of ubuntu
0,[17:11] <jamiewhite> and us
0,[17:11] <txomon> tneva82: use that ctl+alt+t
0,[17:11] <Ender_nothome> tneva82 - why are you infiltrating this channel with your freemasonry
0,[17:11] <thegladiator> I installed natty and went for ubuntu classic
0,[17:11] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: I *think* so but I can't tell. Because I can actually open the new files in SeaDAS if I just want to look at them. The thing that's affected is the processing.
0,[17:11] <meisth0th> tneva82, ok, so you found your own solution, why you keep flaming?
0,[17:11] <thegladiator> ubuntu one is a bit slow for me , is Natty using Gnome 3?
0,[17:11] <Chipzzz> tneva82: you'll have to burn the iso to cd before shutting down
0,[17:11] <txomon> anyone knows about nagios3?
0,[17:11] <jamiewhite> thegladiator: no no no
0,[17:12] <meisth0th> thegladiator, nope, ubuntu is not using gnome anymore
0,[17:12] <tneva82> txomon: ctrl+alt+t=no effect
0,[17:12] <txomon> tneva82:
0,[17:12] <joseph07> wait
0,[17:12] <thegladiator> so whats Ubuntu One using ?
0,[17:12] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: aside from the changed icon, the only other difference is that the processing script now appends a bunch of extra characters to the end of the filename (and then tells me it can't find that file).
1,[17:12] <tensorpudding> thegladiator: no, it has two options, pure GNOME 2 and GNOME 2 + Unity
0,[17:12] <txomon> tneva82: ctl+alt+f1
0,[17:12] <tneva82> nothing as I said before
0,[17:12] <txomon> fuuuu
0,[17:12] <tneva82> it hasn't solved itself
0,[17:12] <Cyb33rcAker> hi man
0,[17:12] <txomon> acpi button?
0,[17:12] <thegladiator> Okay is Ubuntu planning to discard Gnome for better options ?
0,[17:12] <tneva82> what button?
0,[17:12] <Cyb33rcAker> download evilDEB-xbomb_2.1a-7_i386.deb
0,[17:12] <Cyb33rcAker> in
0,[17:12] <Cyb33rcAker> http://192.168.1.2:8000/
0,[17:12] <txomon> tneva82: power button?
1,[17:12] <jamiewhite> thegladiator: Unity
0,[17:12] <happolati> tneva82: windowsbutton, ctl, f1. maybe the modkey has been switch around
0,[17:12] <Cyb33rcAker> ehtra games
0,[17:13] <meisth0th> tneva82, create a new user deleting existing one
0,[17:13] <multipass|2> Hi, does anyone know why for IPHONE, in 10.10 i can only view the photos, but in 11.04 i can mount as root and get full acess to everything including music?? What am i missing in 10.10 (im still using 10.10 for a few reasons)
1,[17:13] <thegladiator> Unity is a Ubuntu project or a seperate Desktop Environment Project ?
0,[17:13] <tneva82> power button is pressed the second file is downloaded :D
0,[17:13] <MonkeyDust> tneva82: ctrl-alt-backspace logs you out, try and reboot from there
0,[17:13] <tneva82> I don't want to waste the time I spent downloading it only to have to download it AGAIN
0,[17:13] <jamiewhite> multipass|2: because they worked on support
0,[17:13] <txomon> tneva82: oki
1,[17:13] <joseph07> i thought unity was more like a gnome plugin
0,[17:13] <Ender_nothome> multipass|2 get rid of the iphone and we'll help
1,[17:13] <tensorpudding> thegladiator: 11.10 will boost to GNOME 3, have a 2D version of Unity as an option, as well as gnome shell, GNOME 3's usual configuration
0,[17:13] <txomon> tneva82: I usually use that to switch down my system (is faster)
0,[17:13] <Cyb33rcAker> hi man download evilDEB-xbomb_2.1a-7_i386.deb
0,[17:13] <Cyb33rcAker> in evilDEB-xbomb_2.1a-7_i386.deb
0,[17:13] <Abhijit> thegladiator, ubuntu project
0,[17:14] <thegladiator> Thanks Abhijit
0,[17:14] <Cyb33rcAker> in http://192.168.1.2:8000
0,[17:14] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: but are there any specific packages i can bring to 10.10 to make it work
0,[17:14] <txomon> anyone something about nagios3?
0,[17:14] <donkeyinspace> where to choose windows graphic effects?
0,[17:14] <gnosis> Cyb33rcAker: are you retarded?
0,[17:14] <Ender_nothome> donkeyinspace - in windows
0,[17:14] <meisth0th> tneva82, try AltGr+PrintScreen+O
0,[17:14] <IdleOne> gnosis: Please don't.
0,[17:15] <jamiewhite> multipass|2: I dont know offhand, I looked into this because I noticed the same but I hate the bloat 11.04. Cant pin it down to a simple package myself yet though
0,[17:15] <tensorpudding> donkeyinspace: if you want fine-grained effects control, you can download the Compiz Config Settings Manager from the Software Center
0,[17:15] <selinuxium> Hi guys, anyone got any experience with grub rescue... I updated to Natty and and now at grub rescue prompt... an ls shows various (hd0,msdos6) down to (hd0,msdos0)...  Encrypted drives so (at least i think they are...)
0,[17:15] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: can you download another copy of a file you know is good and compare them?
0,[17:15] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: yeah for a few reaons, mainly compiz, i cannot use 11.04, its just too much of a pain :\
0,[17:15] <donkeyinspace> tensorpudding , thanks
0,[17:16] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: I can download the same file to a different computer and it runs fine there. I can't download anything to the post-crashed computer. Something happened in the crash.
0,[17:16] <IdleOne> donkeyinspace: do you mean the 3d effects? if so install compizconfig-settings-manager from Synaptic package manager or software centre
0,[17:16] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: i noticed that in 11.04 there is libimobiledevice2, and in 10.10 theres libimobiledevice1
0,[17:16] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: so i assumed thats the difference
0,[17:16] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: also, I've tried downloading a copy of a file that had been downloaded before and run fine, and the new copy does not run.
0,[17:16] <jamiewhite> multipass|2: linux is filled with things that work and dont work, tempting you to resort back to windows. I have to for my ipodtouch.
0,[17:17] <Ender_nothome> jamiewhite - apple is proprietary
0,[17:17] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: is this only a problem when downloading through filezilla?
0,[17:17] <donkeyinspace> Idleone , i meant the "old" jelly effect
0,[17:17] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: right, i use virtualbox xp for iphone, but now with 11.04 everything iphone was working great
0,[17:17] <thegladiator> any recommended Flash plugins ?
0,[17:18] <IdleOne> donkeyinspace: I don't know what jelly effect is. wobbly windows?
0,[17:18] <thegladiator> !flash
0,[17:18] <ubottu> To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash - See also  !Restricted and !Gnash
0,[17:18] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: no, it does the same thing through Firefox. If I click on only one file, it comes down through the web browser. I use filezilla to grab a dozen files at once.
0,[17:18] <IdleOne> donkeyinspace: what version of Ubuntu are you running?
0,[17:18] <jamiewhite> Ender_nothome: doesnt mean that much, flash is but it works
0,[17:18] <donkeyinspace> Idleone , 11.04
0,[17:19] <Furai`> Hello.
0,[17:19] <asteig> Furai: Hello.
0,[17:19] <IdleOne> donkeyinspace: ok, if what you are talking about is the wobbly window effect and all that fancy Cube stuff see /msg ubottu !classic, then install compizconfig-settings-manager and you will have the effects.
0,[17:20] <jamiewhite> multipass|2: from the package page, it seems that libmobiledevice is the source, but can 10.10 repositories give you 2
0,[17:21] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: does this happen to other types of files from other sites?
0,[17:21] <joseph07> jamiewhite: probably
0,[17:22] <jamiewhite> ill test
0,[17:23] <joseph07> jamiewhite: good plan. Someone mentioned vms too; that might be a viable alternative to save you restarts
0,[17:23] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: ive been trying to get libimobiledevice2 on 10.10 but no luck yet
0,[17:24] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: that would be hard to test for because there's really only one site and one seadas. But it does still work just fine on a separate computer, where I installed ubuntu and seadas yesterday specifically to check that. I think I can safely eliminate the oceancolor server as being at fault. The only difference is in how things download pre- and post-crash.
0,[17:24] <jamiewhite> found this: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/12/get-ios4-mountsync-working-in-ubuntu.html
0,[17:24] <fabio__> thanks all
0,[17:24] <fabio__> see you soon
0,[17:24] <MnCC> how can i change the wallpaper on the login screen ?
0,[17:25] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: can you run md5sum on pre- and post-crash copies of the same file?
0,[17:25] <Abhijit> MnCC, use ubuntu tweak. or use gdm2setup
0,[17:25] <MnCC> Abhijit, tnx
1,[17:25] <osama> (running legacy gnome.... how do I get used to unity ... still doesn't make sense to me...)
0,[17:26] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: i meant if you download like a jpeg or tar from some random site, does it also end up corrupted?
1,[17:26] <Soupermanito> osama, you dont, you just use another gui, unity fails hard
0,[17:26] <coz_> osama,  not hard ,, simply log off,,  put in your password but before you hit Enter  change the session to  "UBuntu:
0,[17:27] <osama> Soupermanito, that's what I'm doing...
0,[17:27] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: but what does dist upgrade do
0,[17:27] <jamiewhite> it doesn't even appear in the ubuntu repositories
0,[17:28] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, wont that make it 11.04
0,[17:28] <josuf107> jamiewhite: http://www.libimobiledevice.org/
0,[17:28] <Pici> !dist-upgrade | multipass|2
0,[17:28] <ubottu> multipass|2: A dist-upgrade will install new dependencies for packages already installed and may remove packages if they are no longer needed. Please see !upgrade for the proper way to upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu.
0,[17:28] <Soupermanito> osama ;) good then, try differents, use lxde, xfce, etc etc, you will find one that makes you happy
0,[17:28] <osama> Soupermanito,  I still prefer gnome 2
0,[17:28] <josuf107> jamiewhite: it looks like the latest version is 1.06
0,[17:28] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: I just grabbed a random png, and it looks like a normal png file.
0,[17:29] <Arabus> hey anyone know an appropriate channel to ask questions about fail2ban in?
0,[17:29] <jamiewhite> <multipass|2> no it wont
0,[17:29] <txomon> how can I copy a full linux system with just ssh access?
0,[17:29] <jamiewhite> multipass|2: apparently
1,[17:29] <reduce> how do I change the position of the icons in on the left side of the screen?
0,[17:29] <Pici> Arabus: #ubuntu-server would be a good place.
0,[17:30] <Arabus> Pici:  thanks
0,[17:30] <Arabus> join #ubuntu-server
0,[17:30] <gnosis> txomon: what are you trying to do?
0,[17:30] <Arabus> gah :-( sorry
0,[17:30] <josuf107> txomon: you can use scp
0,[17:30] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: Hey, i think that worked actually.. waoh
0,[17:30] <txomon> gnosis: backup a NAS
0,[17:30] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: thanks!
0,[17:30] <TrentonDAdams> Hi guys, tora won't build on ubuntu.  Any ideas?  qt4-qmake is installed http://dpaste.com/539102/
0,[17:30] <txomon> NAS's firmware gnosis josuf107
1,[17:30] <reduce> I just want to reorder the icons, but clicking and dragging doesn't work
0,[17:30] <jamiewhite> multipass|2: thank google ;)
1,[17:30] <coz_> osama,   did you get to Unity ?
0,[17:31] <alibo``> Hello, I would like to know the installation directory of a package that I installed. How can I get that?
0,[17:31] <Abhijit> alibo``, how you installed it?
0,[17:31] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: if you have pre- and post-crash copies of the same file, do md5sum and see if the hashes are different
0,[17:31] <multipass|2> jamiewhite: actually i did see that distupgrade thing before, but it was scary :O
1,[17:31] <osama> coz_, tried it for 30 minutes, hated it, logged out then back to gnome 2... (legacy?)
0,[17:31] <jamiewhite> josuf107: well I bricked my ipod so now it better work
0,[17:31] <alibo``> Abhijit: sudo apt-get install xx
0,[17:31] <txomon> gnosis: was to backup a busybox NAS
0,[17:31] <Abhijit> alibo``, it will be inside somewhere /usr/bin
0,[17:31] <atari314> http://pastebin.com/bJuYwFJP (txt.cfg from the mini.iso alternate install) anyone have any info about the string "append tasks=standard pkgsel/language-pack-patterns= pkgsel/install-language-support=false vga=788 initrd=initrd.gz -- quiet" parameter? Any doc about it?
0,[17:32] <josuf107> txomon: lookup the ubuntu community article on doing a full system backup
1,[17:32] <coz_> osama,  oh ok,, classic is far better  in terms  of funtionality at this point
0,[17:32] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: working on it. I'm downloading a bad copy now, these files are kind of big
0,[17:32] <alibo``> Abhijit: I see thanks
0,[17:32] <josuf107> txomon: and instead of tar, use scp
0,[17:32] <jamiewhite> multipass|2: I could see why. Everytime I open the updat manager and see the upgrade button i cower
0,[17:32] <josuf107> txomon: it's almost just copying /
0,[17:32] <txomon> josuf107: but aren't there locked files?
0,[17:33] <qin> alibo``: which <program name>, or: locate <name>, or...
0,[17:33] <josuf107> txomon: there are, you'll need root access, and you'll need to not copy some
0,[17:33] <Ender_nothome> jamiewhite you sound like a windows user
0,[17:33] <joost_> Hey there, after trying to install GIMP development version, and messing around with all the dependencies it needs, all symbols (letters) are now replaced by squares. Anyone know what I can do to fix this?
0,[17:34] <ikonia> joost_: why are you doing this ?
0,[17:34] <jamiewhite> Ender_nothome: isn't every one who likes pc gaming? I hate windows. I love linux. I dislike 11.04.
0,[17:34] <joost_> ikonia: doing what, exactly?
0,[17:34] <ikonia> joost_: (I assume) you're trying to build gimp development source builds ?
0,[17:34] <Ender_nothome> jamiewhite and you sound like a kid
0,[17:35] <badbandit> anyone familiar with paypal standard integration?
0,[17:35] <josuf107> txomon: the reason I mentioned that backup article is because it lists all the special files you'll need to exclude from the copy
0,[17:35] <Pici> badbandit: Does this have anything to do with Ubuntu?
0,[17:35] <joost_> ikonia: yes I did, and I didn't expect doing that to mess up my system this badly
0,[17:35] <badbandit> oops, wrong channel lol
0,[17:35] <ikonia> joost_: how did you install the dependencies ?
0,[17:35] <jamiewhite> Ender_nothome: well thats fllattering. I'm not exactly young unless you're mega-old. But its in the eye of the beholder
0,[17:36] <coz_> jamiewhite,   well dont need to stay with 11.04... you can look at like this...LTS  is the stable versions... until 12.04  every version inbetween is experimental... so stick with LTS  for stabiity
0,[17:36] <Ender_nothome> jamiewhite Ubuntu is linux for human beings, not brattty elite hardcore gamerz
0,[17:36] <nhu20> basnhee unable to play
0,[17:36] <nhu20> plugin dwnld failing
0,[17:36] <joost_> ikonia: I downloaded most sources as tarballs from the GIMP ftp
0,[17:36] <coz_> Ender_nothome,  well I think that is a bit harsh
0,[17:36] <ikonia> joost_: that's going to be the problem, you've overwritten some of the ubuntu libs, probably something very simple in terms of what's change, but I don't want to start stripping your system back
0,[17:37] <jamiewhite> coz_: I like my ubuntu spins but I'm default to 10.10.
0,[17:37] <txomon> josuf107: so... which is that article? just found this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem
0,[17:37] <ikonia> joost_: doing that sort of thing you need to be exceptionally careful to not overwrite any of the packges ubuntu provides
0,[17:37] <josuf107> txomon: lemme see if I can refind it
0,[17:37] <jamiewhite> Ender_nothome: Ubuntu is for friendly people, not you.
0,[17:37] <coz_> jamiewhite,   ok cool... 11.04  is still glitchy  although the classic session so far seems decent
1,[17:37] <badbandit> hello, I updated to 11.04 and now when I run skype, it does not show up in the top right and thus I dont know how to access/close it
0,[17:38] <Zelozelos> jamiewhite, i think i may have figured out someting, i installed chromium, and tried again, its shows that the server is not found
0,[17:38] <ese> does anyone know how to change the windows manager back to Gnome 2.XXXX?  I have completely hosed my windows managers trying to accomplish this.
0,[17:38] <joost_> ikonia: yes seeing this happen to myself made me thinl.. :P
0,[17:38] <josuf107> txomon: you're right, they hid it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/TAR
0,[17:38] <jamiewhite> coz_: if I wasn't building from minimal iso in my spare time I would switch up and use 11.04 classic but for the time its not worth it
0,[17:39] <josuf107> txomon: I guess not everyone wants to tar their system when there are special backup-specific tools
0,[17:39] <coz_> jamiewhite,  cool to kn ow you used the mini.iso
0,[17:39] <joost_> ikonia: I installed gegl, babl, glib, zlib, atk, pango, cairo, gdk-pixbuf and gtk+ 2.24
0,[17:39] <aBs0lut30> anybody know the status of the LIO scsi target in natty server? is it there, is it not there, and if its there, what are the package names for the utils?
0,[17:39] <ikonia> ok, so gtk, cairo/glib, all pretty core to ubuntu
0,[17:39] <txomon> josuf107: I supposed that to-... which tool would you recommend, knowing that there is no apt?
0,[17:40] <jamiewhite> coz_: I've been playing around. It's lightening fast, incredible. I'm stuck switching from gdm to lightdm though. Doesnt start on reboot.
0,[17:41] <txomon> how can I upgrade from command line?
0,[17:41] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: yes, the hashes are different.
0,[17:41] <jamiewhite> Zelozelos: thats your internet connection, no?
0,[17:41] <josuf107> txomon: if you have ssh access what you might want to do is ssh into the machine
0,[17:41] <josuf107> txomon: and then create a tar file there
0,[17:41] <txomon> josuf107: no tar
0,[17:41] <josuf107> txomon: and then use scp to copy back to whatever machine you want to inflate it on
0,[17:42] <Zelozelos> jamiewhite, i dont know exactly, i have charter and usually they dont block anything unless its found to be malicious
0,[17:42] <gerber> help with wireless for my lapto , did work with 10.10 but not with 11.04
0,[17:42] <coz_> jamiewhite,   oh!  in all honesty I have not tried lightdm  at all
0,[17:42] <txomon> josuf107: I still have the problem, busybox
0,[17:43] <Zelozelos> jamiewhite, way back when i messed up compiz, i added the metacity --replace as a start up item so i didnt have 2 do it manually every time i booted, maybe you can do somehting like that
0,[17:43] <Error404NotFoun1> can anyone tell me how to get rid of xmarks?
0,[17:43] <gerber> help with wireless for my lapto , did work with 10.10 but not with 11.04
0,[17:43] <josuf107> txomon: you have a linux system that doesn't have tar?
0,[17:43] <jamiewhite> coz_: its got some buzz about it. Its up and coming. Its because its completely themeable.
0,[17:44] <txomon> josuf107: nop, it  a  super minimal one
0,[17:44] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: so files are being corrupted during download, but only from one site, and regardless of app used to download.  and they download fine to other computers
0,[17:44] <coz_> jamiewhite,  excellent news,, i may test it at some point... so at t his stage,, you are sticking with 10.10 ...yes?
0,[17:45] <josuf107> txomon: interesting. ok well then it seems like sshing into that machine won't be that helpful
0,[17:45] <gerber> help with wireless for my lapto , did work with 10.10 but not with 11.04
1,[17:45] <jamiewhite> coz_: yeah, I got all my customisations on it and 11.04 (unity or classic) is too bloated for my liking. Coming from windows even.
0,[17:45] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: yes, looks like it. And only certain files from the site.
0,[17:45] <txomon> josuf107: I will come back later, I must move home
0,[17:45] <txomon> bye!
0,[17:45] <josuf107> txomon: from the machine you wish to copy it to, just scp all the directories except those mentioned in the backup article
0,[17:45] <josuf107> txomon: bye!
0,[17:45] <Zelozelos> gerber you cant get your lappie to connect ?
0,[17:45] <josuf107> txomon: good luck
0,[17:45] <coz_> jamiewhite,  understood
0,[17:46] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: any other problems at all following the crash?
0,[17:46] <gerber> wireless internet
0,[17:46] <gerber> it was working fine with 10.10
0,[17:46] <Zelozelos> gerber please give more info. what does it do when you try to connect?
0,[17:47] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: the first time I booted back up, much of the GUI was messed up. There were error messages about the trash can and other elements. I rebooted and it came up again fine. I tried recovery mode, there were no packages to fix. I emptied /tmp.
0,[17:47] <gerber> it does not show the wireless icone and the light is orange , is blue when it work
0,[17:47] <Zelozelos> gerber when u reply you can type zelo then hit tab to auto-complete and direct your message to me (or someone else) it helps to keep up
0,[17:47] <Simkin> hey guys
0,[17:47] <coz_> Simkin,  hey
0,[17:48] <josuf107> all: if txomon comes back you should tell him that busybox does include the tar utility
0,[17:48] <gerber> Zelozelos, ok
0,[17:48] <jamiewhite> Zelozelos: what was that again?
0,[17:48] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: this is a really strange problem
0,[17:48] <jamiewhite> Zelozelos, oh coool
0,[17:48] <NerwenGreen> gnosis : I know T.T
0,[17:49] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: was the crash anything could have caused hardware damage?  power surge or something?
0,[17:49] <CarlFK> josuf107: but a tar without al the options ;/
0,[17:49] <Yamagata> What should I do if i can confirm that a package is supposed to exist via the packages.ubuntu.com site, but with the repos enabled and an update run it will not show up in my available packages list?
0,[17:49] <gerber> Zelo , my wireless if not working and i reload a fresh install
0,[17:49] <josuf107> carlfk: that should be ok, as long as it can create a tar archive from a list of directories
0,[17:50] <Zelozelos> gerber, goto system, prefs, network connections
0,[17:50] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: well, I wasn't here for the crash. I left the computer on when I left work, and it was turned off when I got in yesterday morning. It's plugged into an expensive APC, and my other computer plugged into the same surge protector was still on and fine.
0,[17:50] <nhu25> banshee not working ?
0,[17:51] <Chipzzz> gerber, does the wireless card show up in lspci?
0,[17:51] <jamiewhite> gerber, Zelozelos he could try wcid or an alternative.
0,[17:51] <jamiewhite> wicd*
0,[17:51] <Zelozelos> gerber, true
0,[17:51] <gerber> is built in
0,[17:51] <CarlFK> josuf107: I dont think it can create anything ... debian/config/config.udeb:# CONFIG_FEATURE_TAR_CREATE is not set
0,[17:51] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: only thing i can think of is maybe an intermittent problem with the hard drive or NIC that leads to data corruption when downloading large files
0,[17:51] <Zelozelos> gerber, you will see a wireless tab, then you'll have 2 addd the network manually
0,[17:51] <drguitar> I'm a newbie who needs help installing a notebook video driver...  Anyone up for frustration?
0,[17:52] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: does the computer have a 2nd nic?
0,[17:52] <CarlFK> josuf107: yeah, I have a script that copies installer log files and stuff to another box, then remotely runs tar on the target.  <grumble>
0,[17:53] <josuf107> carlfk: the busybox docs for it include the -c option
0,[17:53] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: I dont' think so. There's only one ethernet port inthe back..
0,[17:53] <Zelozelos> gerber, is that working out 4 you?
0,[17:53] <gerber> ze
0,[17:53] <gerber> l
0,[17:53] <gerber> ze

0,[17:53] <gerber> can f
0,[17:54] <josuf107> carlfk: oh well that probably settles it
0,[17:54] <Zelozelos> gerber or if u wish we can have a side chat its up 2 u
0,[17:54] <josuf107> carlfk: i haven't used it myself
0,[17:54] <gerber> zilo sorry my keyborad
0,[17:54] <CarlFK> josuf107: yeah, that isn't the same as what the installer uses.  but I missed the OP - is installer where the problem was?
0,[17:54] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: it's running Windows XP at the moment (and is what I'm using to talk in here). It started being a dualboot yesterday afternoon.
0,[17:54] <administrator_> fgfdg
0,[17:55] <thingfish> drguitar: I'm no guru, but which driver are you needing to install?
0,[17:55] <josuf107> carlfk: no problem really, guy just wanted to copy the computer through ssh and I suggested creating a tar archive of it first and then copying that across the network
0,[17:55] <administrator_> hello
0,[17:55] <drguitar> I need the driver for the ATI IGP 320M
0,[17:55] <administrator_> I NEED TOO
0,[17:56] <Abhijit> drguitar, linuxdrivers.org
1,[17:56] <Chillinc> So I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.04, and it's been working fine for 4? days.  I then came back from afk to find that the UI had reverted to some REALLY old icons etc.  I did a reboot and now it hangs before it even gets to the login page.  Any suggestions?
0,[17:56] <drguitar> I have searched the web and found a few "fixes", but nothing has worked so far
0,[17:56] <CarlFK> josuf107: for that, check out http://clonezilla.org - that is basically one of the things it does, but lots of other options too
0,[17:56] <CarlFK> josuf107: but you don't, and he left.. .so oh well :)
0,[17:56] <Chillinc> I can't even get into the recovery console because it hangs there too...so i'm not sure what to do
0,[17:56] <josuf107> carlfk: rats
0,[17:57] <qin> drguitar: In terminal: jockey-gtk , if no driver is listed your card can use only open-source drivers.
0,[17:57] <josuf107> carlfk: well if you see him, let him know
0,[17:57] <josuf107> carlfk: i'm out, bye everyone
0,[17:58] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: you might try downloading a good file from that computer and checking if it gets corrupted
0,[17:58] <TrentonDAdams> if i want to build something in ubuntu 11.04, with qt3 support, how do I do that?  It seems that qt3 is not found, even thought it is installed?  Environment variables? path change?  I'm trying to build an ubuntu package
0,[17:59] <drguitar> Nothing came up... wherewould I find an open source driver?
0,[17:59] <lenovo> ???
0,[17:59] <guampa> what are good screencast apps?
0,[18:00] <coz_> guampa,  well gnome has one that is pretty neat
0,[18:00] <coz_> guampa,  it is alrady onboard
0,[18:00] <defkult> can i use a higher linux kernel than 2.6.28 on ubuntu 10.04?
0,[18:00] <EntityReborn> rsyslog is going crazy on my server 11.04 VPS
0,[18:00] <Chipzzz> drguitar, do you have a gui now or did you install as a server?
0,[18:00] <lenovo> i dont konw
0,[18:00] <EntityReborn> 99% CPU
0,[18:00] <guampa> coz_: which is?
1,[18:00] <coz_> guampa,  are you on Unity or classic gonme
0,[18:00] <guampa> i don't have anything in the menu
0,[18:00] <guampa> 10.10
0,[18:01] <drguitar> I have a GUI, but the ATI radeon card is using the VESA drivers (I believe) and has no 3d capability
0,[18:01] <xangua> TrentonDAdams: try qt4 instead ;)
0,[18:01] <coz_> guampa,  then just go to Applications/ accessories..
0,[18:01] <coz_> guampa,   "Take Screenshot"
0,[18:01] <EntityReborn> Can anyone confirm this?
0,[18:01] <guampa> ahhh
0,[18:01] <defkult> can i use a higher linux kernel than 2.6.28 on ubuntu 10.04?
0,[18:01] <TrentonDAdams> xangua: I can't, tora won't build with it.  The ubuntu package tora-2.1.3 is built with qt3, probably for that reason.
0,[18:01] <coz_> guampa,   the command would be    gnome-screenshot --interactive
0,[18:01] <guampa> but i need one for screencasts, not screenshots
0,[18:02] <guampa> that i knew
0,[18:02] <lenovo> who know YLMF?
0,[18:02] <Zelozelos> what is the network manager command for 11.11?
0,[18:02] <TrentonDAdams> xangua: But, I need oracle support, and it won't find qmake for some reason.
0,[18:02] <coz_> guampa,  ah  then there are 2   either gtk-recordmydesktop  or  kazam
0,[18:02] <coz_> guampa,   kazam is minimal but works
0,[18:02] <defkult> can i use a higher linux kernel than 2.6.28 on ubuntu 10.04?
0,[18:02] <guampa> coz_: great thanks!
0,[18:02] <Zelozelos> err thats 11.04 should it stlll be nm-connection-editor?
0,[18:02] <sangeeth> Hi all..
0,[18:02] <Chipzzz> drguitar, did you run "jockey-gtk -c" ?
0,[18:03] <coz_> guampa,  I dont think kazam is in the repositories however
0,[18:03] <sangeeth> I would like to modify the menu searching concept to be faster in UBUNTU 11.04... Could someone direct me, how to do it?..
0,[18:03] <jamiewhite> Zelozelos, there isnt one is there? i looked into this because I replaced it with connman and then back again but it wont start now
0,[18:03] <ManiZach> Question... When I start the computer, getting into bootloader, there's the newest version option, a repair option and a older version option. The problem I'm having is: When I click on the newest version, it enter some form of 'initialization procedure' where it checks stuff. Then it doesn't go any further. However, when I click on the same version in the previous linux versions it works perfectly... how come?
0,[18:03] <guampa> i'll try with the other one then
0,[18:03] <coz_> guampa,     http://www.webupd8.org/2010/09/try-kazam-new-screencasting-application.html
0,[18:03] <defkult> can i use a higher linux kernel than 2.6.28 on ubuntu 10.04?
0,[18:04] <Chillinc> ManiZach, i'm having the same problem...except i don't have an older version to fall back on
0,[18:04] <ujjain> Hi, how to do a custom ubuntu install without GUI?
0,[18:04] <drguitar> Chipzzz- Nothing happened
0,[18:04] <xangua> !minimal | ujjain
0,[18:04] <ubottu> ujjain: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
0,[18:04] <ujjain> server-install is also without GUI?
0,[18:04] <jamiewhite> ManiZach, i get this all the time installing ubuntu minimal beside my default 10.10. They just hang, I can tget to the bottom of it
0,[18:04] <guampa> coz_: cool
0,[18:05] <defkult> can i use a higher linux kernel than 2.6.28 on ubuntu 10.04?
0,[18:05] <bassliner> when booting, all i see is a pink box instead of a grub menu. how can i change this? also, how can i see boot-messages when ubuntu boots? all i see is a pink rectangle while it boots. thanks.
0,[18:05] <jamiewhite> ujjain, depends what you want?
0,[18:05] <Chipzzz> there probably isn't a driver available that will give you better performance, then. It's a pretty old laptop, isn't it?
0,[18:05] <nishttal> hi I have boost libraries installed in /usr/local/lib.. but when i run my program it still complains ...  error while loading shared libraries: libboost_program_options.so.1.46.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
0,[18:05] <sangeeth> ubottu: Hi, I want to make a modification in the Menu searching of Ubuntu 11.04 to be faster... I know an idea, but I don't know which of the source file to modify.... Could you please help me?..
0,[18:05] <ubottu> Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
0,[18:05] <ujjain> jamiewhite: just a console-only ubuntu, preferably secure, also it´s for a temporary development environment only.
0,[18:05] <nishttal> how do i update ld in ubuntu?
0,[18:05] <ManiZach> Weird stuff is weird.
0,[18:06] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: I just noticed something else that doesn't work right. Tab autocomplete has mostly stopped working too. Umm, would it help if I just reinstalled the whole thing?
0,[18:06] <Abhijit> nishttal, what is ld?
0,[18:06] <defkult> can i use a higher linux kernel than 2.6.28 on ubuntu 10.04?
0,[18:06] <ManiZach> Chillinc, some ubuntu gurus told me to keep my my older versions incase of stuff like this :p
0,[18:06] <xangua> defkult: aah. compile it
0,[18:06] <drguitar> Chipzzz, it is older, but I have read of all sorts of drivers working for this particular laptop and video chipset.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to reproduce their "fixes"
0,[18:06] <Abhijit> defkult, yes.
0,[18:06] <ManiZach> Glad I took the advise.
0,[18:06] <Abhijit> !kernel | defkult
0,[18:06] <ubottu> defkult: The core of Ubuntu is the Linux kernel: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel - You shouldn't have to compile your own, and if you need to troubleshoot issues, you can try a !Mainline kernel instead, but if you insist, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile (see also !Stages)
0,[18:07] <AlienDev> ubuntu 11.04 - is anyone having problems with FTP threw nautilus? for example: I can edit files via ftp or sftp or ssh, and everything still runs fairly smooth, but if i try and drag and drop a file to upload it, it kills the connection and times out the upload. it also reverts the directory nautilus is seeing to "computer:///"
0,[18:07] <jamiewhite> ujjain, the ubuntu minimal iso has what you need as default then. Its just a terminal and the support for commands to install stuff.
0,[18:08] <Chillinc> ManiZach, wish I would've been told the same. =\  Didn't think they'd release a final version that randomly stops booting after a reboot.
0,[18:08] <ujjain> jamiewhite:  great :) apt-get is installed right?
0,[18:08] <Chillinc> I can't even get to the recovery console =(
0,[18:08] <GianlucaR> hello all
0,[18:09] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: i don't any better ideas
0,[18:09] <gnosis> *have any
0,[18:10] <angel232> tds
0,[18:10] <gnosis> NerwenGreen: it's a very strange problem.  i can't think of any kind of software bug that would account for all that.
0,[18:10] <jamiewhite> ujjain, yes it is. If you need anymore I've been investigating and trying to build my own ubuntu from the minimal iso for weeks. For example, if you want the add-apt-repository command, you need to install python-software-properties.
0,[18:10] <Tired_> Hi.  I'm using 11.04 Live USB, and I have a link to an FTP server in my favorites in Nautilus (I think?).  When I click it, it seems to "mount" the FTP server, so it goes into the upper pane above the favorites.  When I go to click it again later, it gives me an error message unless I click the Eject button and re-click the FTP favorites link.  This is annoying, how can I make it not do that?
0,[18:10] <AlienDev> ubuntu 11.04 - is anyone having problems with FTP threw nautilus? for example: I can edit files via ftp or sftp or ssh, and everything still runs fairly smooth, but if i try and drag and drop a file to upload it, it kills the connection and times out the upload. it also reverts the directory nautilus is seeing to "member:computer:///". If someone could check, if it does it to someone else, i would like to report it as a bug.
0,[18:10] <NerwenGreen> gnosis: how does one run fsck in ubuntu? in recovery mode it tells me the drive is mounted and it would cause severe damage if I ran it.

0,[18:13] <Stef_> jamiewhite: i use it as a server (but ubuntu desktop installed)
0,[18:13] <Chipzzz> drguitar, that's curious... have you had proprietary drivers working on an older version of Ubuntu (on that laptop)?

0,[18:17] <jonez> specifically I want to uninstall python-scipy and install it from source
0,[18:17] <Chipzzz> drguitar, sorry... you have to use pastebin to post the output
0,[18:17] <Stef_> gnosis: ssh works, also webserver, fileserver works, it's just the VNC that won't work
0,[18:17] <F-3000> xangua: My ubuntu currently denies to boot, and there's quite a buttload of stuff that I'd need to DIG if I was about to all sudden to upgrade the distro.
0,[18:18] <Bruno`>  I am experiencing "black screens" problems. I made an application, which uses openGl (open scene graph), and works in full screen. After some minutes without using the mouse or the keyboard, the screen goes black.

0,[18:18] <jonez> jamiewhite, it turns out apt-get did the right thing :)

0,[18:21] <coz_> defkult,  11.04  is having issues  not the least of which is user confidence at this point
0,[18:21] <TrentonDAdams> is there an ubuntu developer channel?
0,[18:21] <mang0> DarthPudding i'm NOT reinstalling
0,[18:21] <jamiewhite> mang0: try this maybe <mang0>
0,[18:21] <coz_> defkult,   did you try the classic gnome session instead?
0,[18:21] <Chipzzz> drguitar, I don't know if it worked, you have to put the url where it was pasted in this channel
0,[18:21] <mang0> hm?
0,[18:21] <mang0> jamiewhite what?
0,[18:21] <DarthPudding> mang0: if it's a fresh install, it can't take that long right?
0,[18:22] <defkult> coz_:  i have no issues with 11.04, I just prefer my 10.04 install better
0,[18:22] <jamiewhite> mang0, lol hang on        http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/linux/reset-your-forgotten-ubuntu-password-in-2-minutes-or-less/   there we go
0,[18:22] <Stef_> gnosis: still there ?
0,[18:22] <mang0> It doesn't but i can't be effed to do it all over again
0,[18:22] <DarthPudding> mang0: I'm sure there are more magical solutions, but it works
0,[18:22] <defkult> i have nothing against 11.04
0,[18:22] <mang0> aha!
0,[18:22] <coz_> defkult,  understood...
0,[18:22] <drguitar> http://paste.ubuntu.com/603810/
0,[18:22] <drguitar> sorry
0,[18:22] <Tired_> Is there a way to preserve the changes made to a persistent live USB of 11.04 if you use that same USB to install 11.04?  I have the USB mostly set up good and I don't want to re-do all that if I can avoid it.
0,[18:22] <ujjain> jameswhite: I pressed enter while on basic ubuntu server... does that mean it will not install it? I would have like dmultiple optoins :p
0,[18:22] <GianlucaR> what are the layers involved between wpa_supplicant and NetworkManager? I've been following  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Atheros but no wifi up

0,[18:24] <DarthPudding> I have a question if you guys don't mind. I did an upgrade from Maverick to Natty. now the machine won't boot. I've googled, but nothing found exactly matches. There is a bug open on it, but no text in it. any ideas where to start?
0,[18:24] <moustafa> yay!  Another floodbot!
0,[18:24] <drguitar> Chipzzz, any luck?
0,[18:24] <moustafa> DarthPudding: Can you define "won't boot" ?
0,[18:25] <jamiewhite> ujjain, i think tab and enter skips most of that. Enter should install.
0,[18:25] <defkult> so what version of ubuntu is going to be the next LTS?  Anyone know?
0,[18:25] <moustafa> DarthPudding: Also, laptop or desktop?
0,[18:25] <ujjain> jamiewhite: hope so, :) else I would haev to do everything over again
0,[18:25] <coz_> DarthPudding,  you dont get to grub menu?  is it a black screen?
0,[18:25] <DarthPudding> I'm assuming it hits grub. it's stuck at the nice Ubuntu logo. all 5 of the dots are red.
0,[18:25] <moustafa> defkult: 12.04 is the next LTS
0,[18:25] <DarthPudding> desktop
0,[18:25] <Chipzzz> drguitar, it looks like it's working...
0,[18:25] <coz_> DarthPudding,  ah
0,[18:25] <defkult> cool beans
0,[18:26] <moustafa> DarthPudding: Lastly: Video card type
0,[18:26] <DarthPudding> Virtualbox
0,[18:26] <gdoteof> I have a laptop running 9.10; i rebooted it and it booted into some initramfs ash shell
0,[18:26] <gdoteof> i can't mount my drive
0,[18:26] <hackdmg> salve
0,[18:26] <hackdmg> qualcuno parla italiano?????
0,[18:26] <GianlucaR> ciao hackdmg
0,[18:26] <gdoteof> but, it doesn't seem like it could just be a hardware failure
0,[18:26] <CarlFK> DarthPudding: hold down shift, that should get you the grub menu - pick the 2nd option "...recovery"
0,[18:26] <hackdmg> Ciao GianlucaR
0,[18:26] <Pici> !it | hackdmg
0,[18:26] <ubottu> hackdmg: Vai su #ubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie! (per entrare, scrivi « /join #ubuntu-it » senza virgolette)
0,[18:26] <moustafa> gdoteof: Initramfs may be a corrupt partition, or hard drive failure.  I hope you have backups
0,[18:27] <GianlucaR> hackdmg: io ma non faccio parte del supporto ufficiale, you're requested to speak EN here :)
0,[18:27] <jamiewhite> ujjain, you could just install the server from the terminal that it'll boot up to if not. Those options are easier alternatives than using the command line when next you boot, but can still install anything. Just need the package names.
0,[18:27] <MK``> Support for 9.10 ended on Sunday :P
0,[18:27] <moustafa> DarthPudding: Virtualbox errors are trickier to handle.
0,[18:27] <gdoteof> moustafa: i mostly do.. i will have lost a good chunk of work though
0,[18:27] <ujjain> jamiewhite: does not seem to boot :P
0,[18:27] <DarthPudding> I tried the recovery on the alternate cd, and it didn't seem to help alot. let me try the onboard one
0,[18:27] <F-3000> moustafa: Or he got same problem as I do with ending into busybox.
0,[18:27] <drguitar> Chipzzz, but 3D video tests donot work and most games will not run (like they did before)...
0,[18:27] <gdoteof> more likely a corrupt partition since initramfs must be coming from the hd
0,[18:27] <Chipzzz> drguitar, take a look in Preferences->Appearance->Visual Effects and see what the setting is
0,[18:27] <gdoteof> moustafa: any hints on where to look for attempting to recover?
0,[18:27] <mang0> jamiewhite: The grub menu doesn't come up D:

0,[18:28] <Chaorain> Hey I have a live USB, partition 1 is Fat32 and Partition 2 is ISO(some numbers). Grub is installed on partition 1 but when I try to boot to the drive I just et a GRUB Bash, Help?
0,[18:28] <jamiewhite> ujjain, first: what minimal iso is it? second: does it just get stuck at the underscore at boot?
0,[18:28] <drguitar> Chipzzz, the setting is at "none"
0,[18:28] <F-3000> gdoteof: is there text "ALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/... does not exist. Dropping to a shell!" ?
0,[18:28] <gdoteof> F-3000: no
0,[18:28] <Chipzzz> drguitar, Set it to Normal
0,[18:28] <moustafa> gdoteof: I had a similar issue recently.  The only way I was able to get my data off the drive was to give it a slight hit on one of its sides.  Otherwise, the data would have been lost on the drive.
0,[18:28] <gdoteof> when i try and mount it says attempt to access beyond end of device3
0,[18:28] <ujjain> jamiewhite: mini.iso 32bit, 11.04. it did the first time only underscore, 2nd time a white line.
0,[18:28] <DarthPudding> CarlFK: I'm at the recovery menu.. which option?
0,[18:28] <jamiewhite> mang0, same at you: does it just get stuck at the underscore at boot?
0,[18:29] <gdoteof> moustafa: but it's weird because i would assume initramfs would not even come up if the hd was f'd
0,[18:29] <mang0> IDk, I rebooted and it runs memory check like it used to with windows, then goes straight to the account menu in ubuntu
0,[18:29] <jamiewhite> ujjain, see I'm having this problem. I've had to revert to 10.10 minimals because somethings wrong with 11.04
0,[18:29] <mang0> jamiewhite: ------------^
0,[18:29] <DarthPudding> !help
0,[18:29] <ubottu> Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
0,[18:29] <moustafa> gdoteof: It may be able to read the first 512 kb on the drive, which is enough.  If you're unable to even mount the drive from a LiveCD, it may be your issue.
0,[18:29] <DarthPudding> :)
0,[18:29] <drguitar> Chipzzz,  Hmmm, it is now working...  I checked this several times over the last week and it would always tell me that I could not go to that seting.
0,[18:29] <Tired_> The error message I get in Nautilus on the FTP server is "Sorry, could not display all the contents of "TV Shows": Host closed connection".  Works fine when I eject and re-click it.
0,[18:29] <ujjain> jamiewhite: this is a fresh install. I think I will do it again with the server cd.
0,[18:29] <moustafa> gdoteof: What's the drive make?
0,[18:30] <CarlFK> DarthPudding:   um.... I forget what they are.   and need to run.. can someone else take over?
0,[18:30] <Chipzzz> :))
0,[18:30] <funnylookinhat> With 10.10 I was able to Alt + Right Click windows to be able to set them to be on every workspace, etc... now it doesn't seem to work anymore ( Ubuntu Classic 11.04 ) - Any ideas?
1,[18:30] <Medjai> is it possible to use gnome 2 themes with unity?
0,[18:30] <DarthPudding> resume, repair, grub, ....
0,[18:30] <moustafa> DarthPudding: Try using Boot into Safe Graphics
0,[18:30] <DarthPudding> trying repair now
0,[18:30] <ujjain> jamiewhite: yes, now it´s the underscore. I did install grub, but does not show up, will do reinstall.
0,[18:30] <funnylookinhat> Err - I meant, Alt + Right Click for non-native windows, like Audacious
0,[18:30] <drguitar> Chipzzz, I'll run the 3d est now...
0,[18:30] <MK``> funnylookinhat: your keyboard shortcuts may have gotten reset, is all
0,[18:30] <ActionParsnip> funnylookinhat: are there bugs logged? have you looked in ccsm
0,[18:30] <gdoteof> moustafa: not sure.. it's a lenovo t410
0,[18:30] <jamiewhite> ujjain, i think its 11.04 minimal iso's, try 10.10 maybe?
0,[18:30] <dsouz401> I'm just starting out using IRC. Can someone please explain how to do the IRC registration thing
0,[18:30] <Chipzzz> drguitar, if it works, don't ask too many questions ;)
0,[18:30] <ActionParsnip> dsouz401: ask in #freenode
0,[18:31] <funnylookinhat> ActionParsnip, MK`` I'll try checking keyboard shortcuts with CCSM - good idea, thanks!

0,[18:31] <DarthPudding> moustafa: the funny thing is, I upgraded a maverick on a physical in the same manner, and had no issues.
0,[18:31] <mang0> like, in ubuntu it asks who I'd like to logig as...

0,[18:32] <avinash_mali> but cannot locate it among applications..
0,[18:32] <funnylookinhat> ActionParsnip, MK`` Any idea what category/tool that shortcut would be under?  Gnome Compatability was a no go
0,[18:32] <ActionParsnip> olskolirc: maybe a ppa
0,[18:32] <moustafa> DarthPudding: Physical does not translate to virtual
0,[18:32] <ActionParsnip> funnylookinhat: not sure,i dont use compiz
0,[18:32] <moustafa> gdoteof: I think you found the source of the issue.  My problem was also with a Seagate drive
0,[18:32] <drguitar> Chipzzz, it seems to be 9poorly) but working
0,[18:32] <Tired_> Is what I type here reaching the channel?  Can anyone else see it, or just me?
0,[18:32] <MK``> funnylookinhat: no idea.
0,[18:32] <DarthPudding> moustafa: yeah I know. drivers make the difference
0,[18:32] <anadon> Last time I was here, i didn't need to prove that I am human...was there an attack?
0,[18:32] <moustafa> gdoteof: It was 2.1 years old
0,[18:32] <F-3000> moustafa: Could you give any hint how to try to fix booting on my case? UUID is correct, sda2 is mountable.
0,[18:32] <gdoteof> this one is <1yr
0,[18:33] <moustafa> DarthPudding: Not just that.  Physical components can't be perfectly emulated
0,[18:33] <Zelozelos> anadon if i remember right there were some spoofers and spammers n other things goin on
0,[18:33] <drguitar> Chipzzz, what got it working?
0,[18:33] <Chipzzz> drguitar, you can try the higher setting but I doubt that it will work... I'd call it a success at this point ;)
0,[18:33] <jamiewhite> olskolirc, maybe try the launchpad page?
0,[18:33] <DarthPudding> moustafa: for the most part I've had very little problems with vb, but there is a first time for everything
0,[18:33] <ActionParsnip> Tired_: i can see your text

0,[18:34] <Tired_> Ah, thank you, ActionParsnip.  :)
0,[18:34] <Chipzzz> drguitar, most likely when you were installing the proprietary drivers it needed to be rebooted or cold started or something

0,[18:37] <Jacinator> My microphone isn't working on Ubuntu, it does work on Windows 7 though. Does anyone have an idea on how to fix it?
0,[18:37] <MK``> there is usually a shortcut there to all your programs
0,[18:37] <defkult> looks like it might be integrated into nautilus
0,[18:37] <F-3000> moustafa: I got 9.04 on my laptop. It got some updates yesterday, and today it declined to boot, ending into busybox.
0,[18:37] <jamiewhite> avinash_mali: and it showed you where to find it?
0,[18:37] <moustafa> Jacinator: Have you checked the sound configuration?
0,[18:37] <ileavasile> i instaled radiotray but it says that is a gstream plugin mising and its not working
0,[18:38] <ileavasile> what to to?
0,[18:38] <Jacinator> Yes I have, it does not have my microphone in there.
0,[18:38] <avinash_mali> k
0,[18:38] <DarthPudding> moustafa: stuck at userspace bootsplash on boot. definitely looks like a problem with vb. I need to update the additions. it's possible it can't do video until I re-do the additions

0,[18:38] <GianlucaR> bye all

0,[18:38] <defkult> Stef_: try to look for some sort of task scheduler
0,[18:38] <Tired_> Hi.  I'm using 11.04 Live USB, and I have a link to an FTP server in my favorites in Nautilus (I think?).  When I click it, it seems to "mount" the FTP server, so it goes into the upper pane above the favorites.

This is ann
0,[18:38] <Tired_> oying, how can I make it not do that?
0,[18:39] <moustafa> Jacinator: There is nothing in Input Devices, at all?
0,[18:39] <ActionParsnip> Stef_: i believe you can email from CLI, so you can add the command to your shutdown script but before the networking stops
0,[18:39] <moustafa> Jacinator: Is the input device muted?
0,[18:39] <x-ip> hi
0,[18:39] <moustafa> hello x-ip
1,[18:39] <x-ip> is it possible to put the unity left bar at the bottom ?
0,[18:39] <Jacinator> Yes there is, my webcam microphone is in there, but I do not want that one.
1,[18:39] <MK``> no x-ip
1,[18:39] <moustafa> x-ip: No, not yet
0,[18:39] <x-ip> ups :,(
0,[18:39] <x-ip> thanks :)

0,[18:40] <ubottu> sebrock|away, please see my private message

0,[18:40] <moustafa> F-3000, x-ip No problems

0,[18:41] <ileavasile> i instale radiptray but when i want to play a radio station it says that i have a missing gstream plugin please help me
0,[18:41] <Stef_> ActionParsnip: Yes indeed thanks!
0,[18:41] <ileavasile> radiotray*
0,[18:41] <Jacinator> Moustafa: Yes there is something in my input devices, my webcam microphone is in there, but I do not want that one.
0,[18:42] <wildc4rd> evenin all!
1,[18:42] <Chillinc> i didn't like the left sided unity bar at first...but i agree that it makes more sense to conserve more verticle screen real estate
0,[18:42] <gnewb> Is the Tor Browser Bundle in the repos or do I need to add it to the sources.list and stuff?
0,[18:42] <ActionParsnip> ileavasile: try:  sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
1,[18:42] <MK``> they will probably add the ability to move it to the right for Arabic/etc. support
0,[18:42] <DarthPudding> moustafa: it's alive! stupid vbox additions. you have to update the vbox additions after the upgrade. sigh
0,[18:42] <moustafa> Jacinator: Have you tried booting with the microphone plugged in?
1,[18:42] <Chillinc> why would arabic need it on the right?
0,[18:43] <moustafa> DarthPudding: That's standard procedure
0,[18:43] <koperino> Error mounting: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb2, is the message i get when i connect ipod, anybody help?
1,[18:43] <MK``> Chillinc: most right-to-left scripts mirror the UI as well heh
0,[18:43] <gdoteof> cannot find device with /sbin/init
0,[18:43] <Chillinc> hmm
0,[18:43] <sburwood1> Where do I go to send a error message off the chat room?
0,[18:43] <DarthPudding> moustafa: but usually I can update them after a kernel patch or such after boot. first time it wouldn't boot at all without the additions
0,[18:43] <Chillinc> didn't know that lol
0,[18:43] <Jacinator> Moustafa: Yes I have
0,[18:43] <SavoxUnity> Hey guys, I have been having a problem, I hope its a simple fix, programs like Chromium and XChat will not save my config, chrome asks each time I open if I want it to be default, and Xchat will ALWAYS show the network list and channel list.  I have tried sudo chown myaccount /home/myaccount/*
0,[18:44] <DarthPudding> moustafa: like.. initial install.. I add the additions later. this wouldn't let me back in at all
1,[18:44] <Chillinc> i'd somewhat prefer it on the right if my 2nd monitor wasn't on the right
0,[18:44] <Chipzzz> gdoteof, which device?
1,[18:44] <symaxian> anyone else notice that separate X sessions for separate monitors under nvidia doesnt work with unity?
0,[18:44] <DarthPudding> moustafa: thanks for your help.
0,[18:44] <MK``> Chillinc: see https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ar/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9
0,[18:44] <symaxian> However Twinview works
1,[18:44] <moustafa> DarthPudding: That's because Unity needs Compiz to run by default.  It may have caused an issue with the upgrade
0,[18:44] <moustafa> DarthPudding: No probs
0,[18:44] <ActionParsnip> SavoxUnity: try:  sudo chown -R myaccount:myaccount /home/myaccount
0,[18:44] <Whitor> SavoxUnity, Not sure... just guessing, but when you did a sudo chown ... did you set owner to root?
0,[18:45] <gdoteof> Chipzzz: systemrescue disk just tried alllm ypartitions
0,[18:45] <SavoxUnity> Whitor, ofcourse not, I used my id, savoxis
0,[18:45] <Chillinc> MK``, interesting.  I'm actually taking Arabic next semester so that's good to know ha
0,[18:45]  * SavoxUnity moved to Ubuntu from Gentoo, and knows his way around
0,[18:45] <MK``> :P
0,[18:46] <DarthPudding> moustafa: I went into safe, enabled classic, and still could not get in. it's something with the new driver.
0,[18:46] <Whitor> SavoxUnity, did you use -R ?
0,[18:46] <Chipzzz> gdoteof, do you have a live cd?
0,[18:46] <Whitor> SavoxUnity, nm
0,[18:46] <moustafa> Jacinator: How about in Hardware? Do you see more than one?
0,[18:46] <MK``> I'm heading off guys have a good one
0,[18:46] <SavoxUnity> Whitor, tesing it now, brb
0,[18:46] <ActionParsnip> SavoxUnity: I didn't know that did I. I assume nothing
0,[18:46] <Chillinc>  /sigh im thinking the only option to fix my problem is reinstalling ubuntu
0,[18:46] <Jacinator> Moustafa: In my hardware it says 2 things: Internal Audio and Webcam

0,[18:51] <SavoxUnity> then reopen
0,[18:51] <SavoxUnity> did the trick
0,[18:51] <Chipzzz> sburwood1, have you tried "sudo apt-get update" ?
0,[18:52] <SavoxUnity> thx for the help Whitor
0,[18:52] <FloodBot1> SavoxUnity: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.

0,[18:56] <ganeshran> Hi I just upgraded to Natty. But the normal linux boot is not working. If I select Previous linux versions from the grub menu, it works. Can anyone tell me how to repair the installation
0,[18:56] <gdoteof> it jus tboots into initramfs with an ash shell
0,[18:56] <gdoteof> won't let me mo unt the partition
0,[18:56] <ujjain> Pici: maybe network issue
0,[18:56] <Chipzzz> sburwood1, try "sudo apt-get update" and see if you get the same message
0,[18:56] <fatal_ERROR777> hello to everyone, I have got a problem with a lock screen. If I leave my laptop in that state for a long time, I can's see the window where I suppose to type in my pass to unlock so I am forced to turn it off by a power button. Any ideas of fixing it? Running Ubuntu 11.04.
0,[18:56] <Pici> ujjain: It should be available in main.
0,[18:56] <gdoteof> of course my backups are old
0,[18:56] <Reventlov> gnosis: who are the devs ? :p
0,[18:57] <gsr> I am trying to upgrade ubuntu server from 10.10 to 11.04.  I ran aptitude install update-manager-core, and it installed fine, but do-release-upgrade isn't located anywhere!  Is there something else i must install?

0,[18:57] <Guest1535> Dr_Willis, well it does not.. atleast not properly! i've installed wine with apt-get install wine1.3, downloaded and installed steam with wine msiexec /i file.msi, configured it to run with windows 7 and whenever it loads everything it crashes.
0,[18:57] <moustafa> Jacinator: Try playing with the settings in there.  Alternatively, look in the Input tab, see if you can change the input connector to something else.
0,[18:57] <sburwood1> Chipzzz: The same problem about parsing or opening that - whatever that is
0,[18:57] <ganeshran> Can someone tell me how to repair the upgrade of Natty? Currently my boot is freezing at "Checking Battery State"
0,[18:57] <Jacinator> Moustafa: Alright, will do, I'll contact you afterwards.
0,[18:57] <edbian> fatal_ERROR777: I think your computer is suspending to RAM.  Turn that feature off
0,[18:58] <jrib> gsr: are you sure it's not located anywhere?  update-manager-core provides /usr/bin/do-release-upgrade
0,[18:58] <Dr_Willis> Guest1535:  all ive had to do in the past was run it with that msiecec option, and it worked.   I dident configure it with windows 7 or anything liek that,.
0,[18:58] <ActionParsnip> SavoxUnity: try: rm -r ~/config/chromium     then run the browser
0,[18:58] <Stef_> gnosis: i now use vnc4server for my problem, it works, the problem is, i need to start it first with ssh. can i add a command to rc.local to start vnc4server at startup?
0,[18:58] <ActionParsnip> SavoxUnity: np man (I started on Gentoo ;))
0,[18:58] <ujjain> is there a network config wizard for command line?
0,[18:58] <sburwood1> another command to help me?

0,[18:58] <gusg1> I'm running Ubuntu 10.10. The network manager widget on my top menu bar is blanked out.
0,[18:58] <Chipzzz> sburwood1, try "sudo apt-cache gencaches"
0,[18:59] <Dr_Willis> Stef_:  or sudo might be able to do it.. I did it once ages ago.
0,[18:59] <Guest1535> Dr_Willis, /sadface, it works for me but whenever it is fully loaded it crashes.
0,[18:59] <ganeshran> Someone please help me!! How to repair upgrade of Natty installation.

0,[18:59] <koshie> Hi
0,[18:59] <ActionParsnip> ujjain: wicd has a cli interface, I known network manager has one too but I'm not sure what it is
0,[18:59] <sburwood1> Chipzzz: Same problem ... same error message
0,[18:59] <ujjain> ActionParsnip: does that mean it´ll work via console?
0,[18:59] <ActionParsnip> ujjain: nmcli

0,[19:01] <edbian> ujjain: You do not set the gateway if you're using dhcp
0,[19:01] <ActionParsnip> ujjain: nmcli is the cli applet to configure network manager in cli, personally I use wicd-curses as it has a nice cli gui :)
0,[19:01] <ujjain> edbian: my dhcp might not work correctly.

0,[19:01] <ujjain> well, my internet is not working, I don´t think my dhcp works properly, but I don´t use dhcp
0,[19:01] <douknoukem> it says To install, edit the gplot.pl file and set the first line of the

0,[19:27] <edbian> frybye: Or just point it at /usr/bin/firefox
0,[19:27] <edbian> frybye: I think that's what it wants
0,[19:27] <frybye> ok i will try to change the name.. oh - ok try that

0,[19:28] <Dr_Willis> grobda24:  depends on how old is old.
0,[19:28] <Azelphur> grobda24: ubuntu netbook doesn't exist any more, Ubuntu 11.04 merged them, there's only one release now
0,[19:28] <Chipzzz> sirninja, strange... can you run "grub-install" from the live cd?
0,[19:28] <koshie> new_kid1, I'm not on Ubuntu on this machine, but Fedora. So I don't know if I can use it. I can download the source but can I install it on my Fedora ? I think so.
0,[19:28] <netman> just some time xord crash
0,[19:28] <sirninja> Dr_Willis: I believe I installed it to the MBR, and I've done grub-install too from a livecd, Chipzzz
0,[19:28] <netman> xorg*
0,[19:28] <grobda24> Dr_Willis, this is for a Compaq Armada E500 ... around 8 years old.
0,[19:28] <Dr_Willis> grobda24:  and whats the specs of the thing?
0,[19:28] <spyder99999> Hello all I need a little help with newest version of Ubuntu 11.04
0,[19:28] <new_kid1> koshie: I don't think so
0,[19:29] <koshie> ow :-(
0,[19:29] <sirninja> Chipzzz: there's an ntfs partition called "SYSTEM" with a boot flag... maybe it's going straight to that?
0,[19:29] <edbian> spyder99999: What is yoru issue?
0,[19:29] <Jacinator> I have reported a bug on Touchpad, how will I be contacted if they found a solution?
0,[19:29] <Chipzzz> sirninja, I was just going to ask you about that...
0,[19:29] <spyder99999> I am looking to connect a bluetooth scanner at startup and don't know where to go to modify the bluetooth files.
0,[19:29] <hailtome> actually 11.04 sucks because it doesn't even see my partitions
0,[19:29] <edbian> Jacinator: The email account you registered with will get sent emails
0,[19:29] <Jacinator> Edbian: Thank you very much
0,[19:29] <edbian> Jacinator: sure
0,[19:30] <sirninja> Chipzzz: Should I install grub to that? Isn't in general a bad idea to install grub to partitions like that though?
0,[19:30] <frybye> edbian: in usr/bin/ is only "X11"
0,[19:30] <netman> Any one have problem with nvidia gtx 260 ? Just some time Xserver crash
0,[19:30] <edbian> frybye: /usr/bin/  should have much much more it in
0,[19:30] <Chipzzz> sirninja, You probably have to use gparted to make the other partition (where you installed grub) bootable
0,[19:31] <frybye> yeah but not when using the import window from chromium with this "application/x-html" filter..??
0,[19:31] <spyder99999> the bluetooth files i am referring to are /etc/default/bluetooth and /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf
0,[19:31] <MnCC> i have sudden logouts, when i start a random new application .. this happens randomly (6-10 ) times a day ... anyone ?
0,[19:31] <edbian> frybye: Applications have no extension.  How are you importing using chrome?
0,[19:31] <sirninja> Chipzzz: Ok. That's the bit I'm confused about. I believe it's installed onto /dev/sda.. With the root directory being on /dev/sda7, does that mean /dev/sda7 needs the boot flag?
0,[19:31] <edbian> frybye: it should not be looking for an application
0,[19:32] <Chipzzz> sirninja, yes
0,[19:32] <frybye> shure... but chromium - not google-chrome-stable..
0,[19:32] <edbian> frybye: They should be exactly the same here.
0,[19:32] <edbian> frybye: What are you clicking on to import bookmarks?
0,[19:33] <frybye> thr format that it is filtering for is "application/x-html" gawd knows what that is..?
0,[19:33] <edbian> frybye: How are you trying to import bookmarks in chrome?  What are you clicking on in the gui?

0,[20:54] <mang0> I have the alternate 11.04 installation CD
0,[20:54] <mang0> how do i get to pool?
0,[20:54] <txomon> frostschutz: so have you found something about converting raid1 into single devices?
0,[20:55] <SqRt7744> y'all are oldskool, i'm already on 12.04
0,[20:55] <BlipInTheData> Whats going on O.o
0,[20:55] <frostschutz> necromancer: if people start spam-joining staff channels and spamming staffers, its malicious all right. question is how many people fall for that
0,[20:55] <Cyberkilla> No school like the old school.
0,[20:55] <reval> insert it into the drive, if you're in the main system it should automount and then you can open it from there. However if your system is  not installed, then my guess is it will be a base directory in the file system as it is on the base level of the cd
0,[20:56] <mang0> I've installed it fine
0,[20:56] <mang0> let me try
0,[20:56] <mang0> thanks
0,[20:56] <DigitallyBorn> Hey, everybody. How can I use 'safe graphics mode' in the 11.04 installer?
0,[20:56] <maxflax> I have problem upgrading to Natty - This is the logs which make no sense to me. apt.log http://paste.ubuntu.com/603873/ and main.log http://paste.ubuntu.com/603874/
1,[20:56] <g105b> Hi all, in 11.04 Unity, can anyone recommend any good indicators?
0,[20:57] <txomon> anyone something about RAID1 to Separated devices?
1,[20:57] <g105b> I'm looking for an indicator to alert me when I press caps lock because my keyboard doesn't have a light
0,[20:57] <Zelozelos> when making a script to run a file how do i add a pause b4 another command is given?
0,[20:58] <cjaredrun> if capslock= true emit really annoying high pitched sound g105b
0,[20:58] <cjaredrun> ?
0,[20:58] <Dulak> g105b: the quick fix is to remap capslock to something else, I remap mine to esc for vi, for instance
0,[20:58] <calimocho> Zelozelos: sleep.  like $ sleep 10
0,[20:58] <calimocho> g105b: i map mine to Ctrl for emacs
0,[20:58] <Zelozelos> calimocho, awsome thank you
0,[20:58] <symaxian> Hey guys after upgrading to 11.04 the trackpad stops working on my macbook, any fix?
0,[20:58] <JPP> txomon: since Mdadm uses linux software RAID partitions you'd need to copy the files to another disk, wipe the RAID disks and reformat them with a normal linux filesystem
0,[20:58] <VCoolio> Zelozelos: or && to execute one after another (if the first one succeeds)
0,[20:59] <txomon> JPP: I use hardware based RAID
0,[20:59] <Zelozelos> i think sleep is what i want
0,[20:59] <txomon> but linux uses it
0,[20:59] <Zelozelos> ty guys
0,[20:59] <symaxian> DigitallyBorn, Boot into the recovery mode of ubuntu and select failsafe graphics mode
0,[20:59] <JPP> txomon: then it is not possible without copying to another disk, disabling RAID and reformatting the entire drive.
0,[20:59] <symaxian> Oh the installer, idk
0,[20:59] <xsinick> Linux Multi Media Studio is not showing up in any Natty lenses / menu systems can some one check it out?
0,[20:59] <g105b> This is exactly what I want, but I can't seem to get it working in 11.04: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/indicator-keylock-ubuntu/
0,[21:00] <gabor_> Hi every one
0,[21:00] <txomon> JPP: but RAID 1  is an exact copy... can't I transform

0,[21:00] <JPP> txomon: depends on the RAID controller I guess. maybe try booting the computer under one RAID disk without it being in RAID mode?
0,[21:00] <guntbert> g105b: then there is lock-keys-applet  too
0,[21:00] <JPP> if it boots then it will probably work.
0,[21:00] <multipass|2> what does that "enable sasl" do, that the spamers spam
0,[21:00] <txomon> JPP: its a NAS
0,[21:01] <gabor_> I need to install back windows 7 to be able to use some  programs, and i would need
0,[21:01] <txomon> I have system in a rom
0,[21:01] <gabor_> some help with it
0,[21:01] <g105b> guntbert: sorry?
0,[21:01] <petisnnake> Hi, any ideas why my internet is super slow in ubuntu? In win its blazing fast, in Ubuntu I have to wait a minimum of 10 seconds for each site to load. I have updated everything, even updated to 11. I disabled Ipv6 in all browsers, and it's still super slow. any ideas?
0,[21:01] <xsinick> Linux Multi Media Studio is not showing up in any Natty lenses / menu systems can some one check it out?
0,[21:01] <xsinick> I got it to work
0,[21:01] <Seven_Six_Two> thanks. shakes and shows a number. only got "1" though. I don't know if it means 1 person, or 1 channel. anyone?
0,[21:01] <txomon> The main thing is how to disable RAID hardware
0,[21:01] <JPP> txomon: a physical PC running as NAS? or one of those NAS boxes that you buy?
0,[21:02] <txomon> nas box
0,[21:02] <JPP> if it's the latter, consult the NAS manual or get in touch with their support.
0,[21:02] <DigitallyBorn> To answer my own question for the group, to get safe graphics mode at the installer, hit F6, then escape to see the boot options. Before the "--" add "vga=814" ... this will use 800x600 32bit
0,[21:02] <vanguard> how can I quickly put some arrows in a screenshot?
0,[21:02] <txomon> JPP: But I want to put my own kernel
0,[21:02] <Dattebayo> hey guys i have serious problem i think while i ls /media it shows me the other hard drive i attached
0,[21:02] <guntbert> g105b: that applet might also do what you want , try /msg ubottu info lock-keys-applet
0,[21:02] <Seven_Six_Two> vanguard, how quickly can you open the gimp?
0,[21:02] <txomon> Ubuntu based
0,[21:02] <g105b> vanguard: print the screenshot out and use a bow to fire them at the paper
0,[21:02] <JPP> txomon: I imagine it wouldn't be possible if it's hardware RAID though, as the controller may refuse to read an ex-RAID partition in normal RAID mode
0,[21:02] <txomon> thats why
0,[21:03] <vanguard> Seven_Six_Two: how do I add a arrow in GIMP?
0,[21:03] <VCoolio> gabor_: either install w7 and then reinstall grub to be able to get to ubuntu again and have dual boot; or use virtualbox to install w7, if it's just for some apps, do the latter
0,[21:03] <vanguard> g105b: and then scan it right back in, right …
0,[21:03] <JPP> txomon: consult your manual for the NAS Box, if it doesn't say you can you probably can't.
1,[21:03] <g105b> guntbert: I have installed lock-keys-applet but I don't see anything... says its installed under apt-get, but I see no indicator.
0,[21:03] <maxflax> I have problem upgrading to Natty - This is the logs which make no sense to me. apt.log http://paste.ubuntu.com/603873/ and main.log http://paste.ubuntu.com/603874/
0,[21:03] <JPP> but i'm only guessing here, as there are a lot of NAS boxes out there.
0,[21:03] <Seven_Six_Two> vanguard, how nice does it have to look? select the pencil, make it thicker (if you want), choose a colour, and draw one. If you're physically challenged, it might take a while longer.
1,[21:03] <g105b> and I see no message when I press caPS LOCK
0,[21:03] <txomon> JPP: the case is, I have 2 x2TB disks and I want RAID1 till I fill it, once filled, disable RAID1 and put as single devices
1,[21:04] <guntbert> g105b: right click on the panel, add applet, there you should find it
1,[21:04] <reval> g105b are you using unity?
0,[21:04] <Zelozelos> calimocho, that WAS perfect, every time my sys started cario dock was jumping applets all over my screen, ive tried all kinds of fix's, , simplest answer, made a script w the sleep (thanks to you) and now problem resolved
1,[21:04] <g105b> reval: yeah
0,[21:04] <Vampire0_> juanito99, is a spammer, could anyone with power remove that idiot please?
0,[21:04] <JPP> txomon: Not sure if it would work when you unlink. It may insist to wipe the disk before it unlinks the array.
0,[21:04] <vanguard> Seven_Six_Two: I have thought of that before of course, but I would like to add a computer drawn arrow, if you know what I mean
1,[21:04] <g105b> guntbert: I'm using unity
0,[21:04] <calimocho> Zelozelos: excellent, glad to have helped
0,[21:05] <Pici> Vampire0: Can you pm me what you're being sent from them?
1,[21:05] <BigD__> hi how do you get unity to work on unbuntu on a virtual machine im using vm ware player?
1,[21:05] <reval> g105b I'm not sure that unity supports that sort of applet currently. Looking into it
1,[21:05] <guntbert> g105b: ah - I'll have to look myself
0,[21:05] <JPP> txomon: Pretty sure no-one will be able to provide a definate answer unless they've tested it on the exact same box themselves.
0,[21:05] <Zelozelos> calimocho, maybe eventually ill fig out what the real issue is
0,[21:05] <txomon> JPP: It is just as if would be a linux question, no matter where, as it uses linux kernel
0,[21:05] <Seven_Six_Two> vanguard, oh, you can get all sorts of clipart from the openclipart package. Then just add it on to a new layer. Or you can open your screenshot in tuxpaint. It's for kids, but there are stamps, and there are definitley arrows.
0,[21:06] <txomon> JPP: im gonna ask #kernel
0,[21:06] <mehdi> can install netbean 7 on ubuntu 11.04
1,[21:06] <reval> g105b this was what I found, guess other apps are needed to attach things to, the top bar in unity is off limitshttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1696330
0,[21:06] <Chepoll> My keyboard layout for virtual consoles gets reset at every boot, and I have to reconfigure console-data. How can I fix this please?
0,[21:06] <vanguard> Seven_Six_Two: clipart sounds like a plan
0,[21:06] <Cheese> Hey
0,[21:06] <escoloader> hi
0,[21:06] <Seven_Six_Two> mehdi, if it's in the repostories, yes. if not, try it and let us know!
0,[21:06] <JPP> that would be a good idea txomon. But bear in mind it is not dependant on the kernal if it is HW RAID. it is dependant on the hardware RAID controller.
0,[21:07] <Seven_Six_Two> vanguard, it's a large package. if you're on dialup, plan on doing other things while you wait  ;)
0,[21:07] <mehdi> no its not in the repostories
0,[21:07] <flowbee> hey folks... trying to run a php executable via command line.  i added the ~/bin directory to my $PATH var via .bashrc.... but when i try to run the command i get "command not found"... when i run it from that directory ./get-shit-done it works... how do i make it so i can run this program from any dir (i already made it executable)
0,[21:07] <Cheese> I just installed fedora which got rid of my old GRUB2 and ubuntu is not included in the new boot loader GRUB .97. Is there any way i can add ubuntu to this new bootloader?
0,[21:07] <vanguard> Seven_Six_Two: 300 KB/s
0,[21:07] <sluther> flowbee: source ~/.bashrc, then try again?
0,[21:07] <txomon> flowbee: have you a php interpreter?
0,[21:07] <BigD__> ?
0,[21:07] <flowbee> txomon, yes php5-cli
0,[21:07] <mehdi> anyone knows how to enable sound on ubuntu 11.04 runing on iMAC?
0,[21:07] <Seven_Six_Two> vanguard, a few minutes then. It's over 100MB I'm sure
0,[21:08] <Cheese> How do i add an operating system to GRUB
0,[21:08] <flowbee> sourcing worked

0,[21:08] <ubottu> Cheese: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
0,[21:08] <Seven_Six_Two> Cheese, sorry!
0,[21:08] <petisnnake> Hi, any ideas why my internet is super slow in ubuntu? In win its blazing fast, in Ubuntu I have to wait a minimum of 10 seconds for each site to load. I have updated everything, even updated to 11. I disabled Ipv6 in all browsers, and it's still super slow. any ideas would be greatly greatly appreciated

0,[21:09] <darkpigeon> Could someone recommend to me an inexpensive laptop with good hardware compatibility for 10.04LTS? Or where I can find a list online?
0,[21:09] <Cheese> I was just rephrasing because the first thing i said was kinda confusing>
0,[21:09] <tensorpudding> Cheese: you usually don't have to
0,[21:09] <Oblat> I'm using Ubuntu 10.10,  my brightness button would stop working randomly. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this random behavior? And how could I enable this buttons back to normal?
0,[21:09] <tensorpudding> Cheese: GRUB will detect them for you
0,[21:09] <Cheese> tensorpudding: When you install fedora it erases your old bootloader.
0,[21:09] <Oblat> My media buttons also were disabled. How can I enable them back?
0,[21:10] <abys> darkpigeon I like dell and never had any big issue with ubuntu ;)
0,[21:10] <tensorpudding> Cheese: is Fedora using GRUB 2?
0,[21:10] <mcf3782> I'm new to Ubuntu, but have been a Linux user/admin for quite some time.   A Ubuntu 10.10 box has Postfix installed.   I'm getting 'connection timed out' trying to connect to the ISP's mailhost.  The postfix log seems to show that when a DNS query is issued, it's getting the wrong IP address for 'mail.bellsouth.net'.  If I do an nslookup mail.bellsouth.net, I get a different address.
0,[21:10] <Cheese> This version of GRUB is not detecting 11.04 on my PC
0,[21:10] <Cheese> tensorpudding: Fedora 14 is using GRUB legacy
0,[21:10] <mcf3782> I can 'telnet mail.bellsouth.net smtp' and get a connection.
0,[21:10] <adsworth> anyone know how I can disable bluetooth on startup in lucid?

0,[21:11] <mcf3782> I've hardcoded an IP address for mail.bellsouth.net in /etc/hosts, and set nsswitch.conf to 'hosts files'. It still seems to lookup the wrong address.
0,[21:11] <tensorpudding> Cheese: but you have to edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst file by hand
0,[21:11] <Seven_Six_Two> mcf3782, I'm guessing here, but is it possible that you previously...haha I was going to say the hosts file
0,[21:12] <Cheese> tensorpudding: would i be editing that file within the operating system?
0,[21:12] <tensorpudding> Cheese: it's in the /boot partition of Fedora, i think
0,[21:12] <nit-wit> somebody needs to dos a ip
0,[21:12] <Chepoll> Cheese: there was an app called BootManager or something in the repositories. Check it via Synaptic and you may find something that enables you to config the grub file a tad bit easier.
0,[21:13] <tensorpudding> Cheese: to be sure, you should ask in #fedora

0,[21:14] <nit-wit> abys, look in the adiitional drivers and see if any are there
0,[21:14] <Cheese> Chepoll: is there no way to boot into a certain partition before booting into an operating system?
0,[21:14] <abys> nit-wit there is video driver available but can't download it cause I don't have any network
0,[21:15] <Seven_Six_Two> mcf3782, which one is wrong? do you get 69.56.222.10 or 207.115.11.17 or 204.127.217.17
0,[21:15] <nit-wit> abys, so logically what do yoou y=thnk is the answer.
0,[21:15] <abys> I hope it detected the wireless drivers like my dell studio...
1,[21:15] <mike3> hey guys, how do i change the unity shortcut places?

0,[21:16] <mcf3782> I get 205.152.58.33
0,[21:16] <AdmiralVorian> hey everyone, I'm trying to force-install an i386 package on natty 64 bit, i try ignore-depends but I still get a list of dependency issues and "dependency problems - leaving unconfigured "
0,[21:16] <abys> regarding the fact that the usb key i use to intall it works fine I have no clue :/
0,[21:16] <mcf3782> should be one of the 207 or 204 addresses
0,[21:16] <Chepoll> Cheese: If I remember right, Grub mounts the partition and then initiates the kernel on it. I was puzzled by how to do it by hand but perhaps you can. Just boot to grub, and then switch to console mode and there you have a set of commands to work with.
0,[21:16] <Jemt> Hi. I find it confusing that Ubuntu mounts CDs on dynamic mount points (/media/CD-label) - why doesn't /cdrom point to the mounted CD-ROM? Is it accessible through a fixed mount point ?
1,[21:16] <mike3> tensorpudding: yes where it says browse the web, view photos, check mail, listen to music
0,[21:16] <mcf3782> let me clarify
0,[21:17] <Cheese> Chepoll: i think ill just reinstall grub2. Im very new to this kind of stuff
0,[21:17] <abys> I installed 10.10 last year and I don't remember having this probleme
0,[21:17] <Socky_> How do i tell ubuntu to switch from PDT time to EST time
0,[21:17] <Seven_Six_Two> mcf3782, that's odd... I would suggest changing to a different dns server and trying again. maybe 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4
0,[21:17] <mcf3782> Postfix get the 205 address. I get the correct addresses from an nslookup on any box on the Internet I try from.
1,[21:17] <Heron_Marked> Hola.  I had Ubuntu Desktop i386 10.10 and swapped up to 11.04.  I had trouble with audio (PulseAudio) and tried to switch to Alsa.  I somehow deleted my volume control applet and can't add it again.  I clicked to add applet and find many things I can add, but volume is not one of them.  Any suggestions?
0,[21:17] <Chepoll> Cheese: good luck is all I can say.
0,[21:17] <damiano546> hey guys can i use iptables to "prevent" dos attacks?
0,[21:17] <Chepoll> My keyboard layout for virtual consoles gets reset at every boot, and I have to reconfigure console-data. How can I fix this please?
0,[21:18] <Seven_Six_Two> mcf3782, oh ok. so only postfix
0,[21:18] <tensorpudding> Cheese: i think it's possible to tell the installer to not overwrite GRUB, it's a bunch of manual work unfortunately
0,[21:18] <mcf3782> Seven_Six_Two: Shouldn't setting 'hosts files' and hardcoding the address in /etc/hosts to the correct one bypass any DNS server issues?
0,[21:18] <Cheese> Ok for grub2 reinstallation, you have to know the partition to mount it to.
0,[21:19] <Seven_Six_Two> have you tried   cat postfixconfigfile.conf | grep <wrong.ip.address>
0,[21:19] <Cheese> And i have 3 partitions that i dont know of. First off i have windows, fedora, and ubuntu. Then i have a 500mb one, a 10gb one, and a 3gb one
0,[21:19] <guntbert> Socky_: system/adminstration/time and date
0,[21:19] <Cheese> Im not sure which one is the bootloader :/
0,[21:19] <Seven_Six_Two> mcf3782, it should, I would think, but I'm not in to postfix. just a general helper.  ;)
1,[21:19] <xangua> Heron_Marked: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop , to reinstall all default packages
0,[21:19] <OY1R> can i somehow connect to freenode webchat with xchat client ?
0,[21:19] <Cheese> How big is a bootloader partition usually?
0,[21:20] <sholmes> So with ubuntu's apache, modules are located in /mods-available and have the extension .load instead of .so?
1,[21:20] <Heron_Marked> xangua, thank you.  Am trying that now.  Will let you know.
0,[21:20] <maxflax> I have problem upgrading to Natty - This is the logs which make no sense to me. apt.log http://paste.ubuntu.com/603873/ and main.log http://paste.ubuntu.com/603874/
0,[21:20] <Chepoll> Cheese: you can use the gui tool gksudo gparted to check yours, fyi.
0,[21:20] <mcf3782> I'll keep looking.
0,[21:20] <Kartagis> what package do I need to clone a git repo?
0,[21:20] <Socky_> guntbert: whenever i change it there it auto maticaly resets to 3 hours back.  I have use the command ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com.  When i type the date command it says Im in PDT rather then EST.
0,[21:20] <Seven_Six_Two> Cheese, should be at least 100mb
0,[21:20] <abys> maxfiax I tried to upgrade and finish by a full install
0,[21:20] <reval> maxflax, what is the os you are upgrading from, and what was the command that you typed? (are you upgrading from desktop or server install?)
0,[21:20] <adsworth> Kardos, git
0,[21:21] <Chepoll> Kartagis: you need "git"
0,[21:21] <abys> it's much faster
0,[21:21] <AdmiralVorian> Does anyone know how to install a 32 bit package on 64 bit 11.04?
0,[21:21] <adsworth> Kartagis, git
0,[21:21] <calimocho> Kartagis: i believe it's called git-core on 'buntu
0,[21:21] <Cheese> Seven_Six_Two: Do you think the 500mb partition is GRUB?
0,[21:21] <omichalek> hi all, my rhythmbox does not play mp3's, I do have ubuntu-restricted-estras installed
0,[21:21] <reval> AdmiralVorian what package?
0,[21:21] <Chepoll> My keyboard layout for virtual consoles gets reset at every boot, and I have to reconfigure console-data. How can I fix this please?
0,[21:21] <Seven_Six_Two> Cheese, the kernel has to be in the first partition, iirc.
0,[21:21] <AdmiralVorian> reval: I'm trying to force-install an i386 package on natty 64 bit, i try ignore-depends but I still get a list of dependency issues and "dependency problems - leaving unconfigured "
0,[21:22] <tensorpudding> Kartagis: you want git-scm i think
0,[21:22] <Cheese> what exactly is a kernel?
0,[21:22] <AdmiralVorian> reval: it's citrix client
0,[21:22] <Seven_Six_Two> Cheese, or within the first x MB
0,[21:22] <maxflax> reval - Im upgrading from 10.10 desktop via the upgrade tool
0,[21:22] <tensorpudding> Kartagis: wait, i meant git
0,[21:22] <Seven_Six_Two> Cheese, the kernel is "Linux". it's what has direct control of all hardware
0,[21:22] <tensorpudding> !kernel | Cheese
0,[21:22] <ubottu> Cheese: The core of Ubuntu is the Linux kernel: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel - You shouldn't have to compile your own, and if you need to troubleshoot issues, you can try a !Mainline kernel instead, but if you insist, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile (see also !Stages)

0,[21:22] <Kartagis> tensorpudding: git has no release candidate
0,[21:22] <maz> Like many other people on here, I have a problem.  I keep 99% of all my files on my external HDD.  However I am unable to share this with the computers on my home wireless network.  I understand this is because of the whole thing with the way the drive is formatted and linux likes ntfs but it would have been fat32 because of windows.  What is the best solution without losing the data because there is more data on there then I have space on
0,[21:22] <maz> my laptop?
0,[21:23] <Pici> Kartagis: the package name is git-core
0,[21:23] <reval> Chepoll it's not a perfect fix, but this sort of alias helps, as you can just type in asdf to a terminal to change maps: alias asdf='sudo loadkeys ~/.colemak.kmap'
0,[21:23] <guntbert> Socky_: best not to mix different time setting mechanisms - on the dialog I pointed out you find the time zone AND the option manual/automatic
0,[21:23] <Cheese> Oh ok, im not sure if that helps me determine which partition to reinstall grub2 on. D:
0,[21:23] <AdmiralVorian> maz: what format is your disk?
0,[21:23] <Kartagis> Pici: that worked, thanks
0,[21:23] <Chepoll> adsworth: If I dpkg-reconfigure now, and then reboot my computer, it will be reset
0,[21:23] <DOUK> hello
0,[21:23] <maz> @admiralvorian it came out of the box and i started using it on a windows pc
0,[21:23] <tensorpudding> maz: is it formatted NTFS or FAT32
0,[21:23] <OY1R> maxflax: im no expert at all, but i have tried upgrade, it never worked out to good, i ended up doing a fresh install.
0,[21:24] <DOUK> why does open calc changes my data of my box into a date when i modify it
0,[21:24] <adsworth> Chepoll, then I'm at a loss...
0,[21:24] <Heron_Marked> xangua, finished installing PulseAudio again - it appears.  But still no volume control applet.  Any additional ideas?
0,[21:24] <maz> well It came out of the box and i started using it on a windows pc, but to be honest im only assuming its fat32, i dont know how to check
0,[21:24] <AdmiralVorian> maz: then it's NTFS. you can use it on ubuntu if you install ntfs-3g
0,[21:24] <Chepoll> reval: It is an option, thanks. I am sorry that it's not what I'm looking for though
0,[21:24] <tensorpudding> maz: in either case, if you can see it in Linux, you can probably share it
0,[21:24] <AdmiralVorian> maz: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009
0,[21:25] <maz> thank you very much!!!
0,[21:25] <reval> admiralvorian, do you mean the Terminal Server Client in the software center?
1,[21:25] <biopyte> hi, after login, clicking the first time the main-menu ('ubuntu') button there is a significant delay until the menu pops up. is there a way to eliminate this delay?
0,[21:25] <adsworth> Chepoll, have you tried reinstalling it
0,[21:25] <maz> ill get reading and hopefully will have it sorted!
0,[21:25] <maz> thanks again admiral and tensor
0,[21:25] <Cheese> How would i decide which partition to reinstall GRUB2 on?
0,[21:25] <Chepoll> adsworth: reinstalling console-data ? I can try it. I will see to it and then reboot and then come back to let you know, ok?
0,[21:25] <AdmiralVorian> reval, citrix receiver client - i don't know if that's the same thing as the terminal server client
0,[21:26] <abys> I try to install a fresh ubuntu natty on a sony vaio and I ve got not drivers working. Booting on a live usb key workis great. Booting after install I ve got no usb,display,sound,network any idea?
0,[21:26] <reval> maxflax then based off of the logs I have no idea, and tend to go with the reinstall guy =( maybe someone else knows better though!

0,[21:26] <DOUK> when i modify the data inside of a box it changes the data into a date
0,[21:26] <adsworth> flowbee, escape the space as well
0,[21:27] <Pici> flowbee: you need to put the backslash before the space
0,[21:27] <OY1R> DOUK: change the cell format
0,[21:27] <DOUK> well i just tried
0,[21:27] <adsworth> or start with a ' that'S the way it works in excel anyways
0,[21:27] <DOUK> but it still changes to a date
0,[21:27] <guntbert> OY1R: why would you want to do that?
0,[21:28] <maxflax> reval - was hoping to avoid a reinstall, it takes so much time
1,[21:28] <mike3> hey guys, how do i change the unity shortcut places?
0,[21:28] <mike3> tensorpudding: yes where it says browse the web, view photos, check mail, listen to music
0,[21:28] <mike3> this is driving me nuts
0,[21:28] <adsworth> DOUK, or start with a ' in the cell that'S the way it works in excel anyways

0,[21:29] <mang0> woot
0,[21:29] <reval> neat!
0,[21:29] <DOUK> why do i have to add ' in front of my number for that to work
0,[21:29] <DOUK> why does it change my thing to a date if i dont
0,[21:29] <DOUK> it doesnt make any sense
0,[21:30] <reval> maxflax what command did you use again for the upgrade?  or did you follow a guide?
0,[21:30] <DOUK> and the thing is that it only does this to some boxes
0,[21:30] <DOUK> some act normally
0,[21:30] <adsworth> DOUK, it's trying to be intelligent and failing...
0,[21:30] <mang0> Hmmmm
0,[21:30] <DOUK> is there an option to turn off
0,[21:30] <DOUK> whatever the hell it does
0,[21:30] <adsworth> afaik not
0,[21:30] <maxflax> reval - just the normal gui upgrade tool. Even tried the command line tool but no avail.

0,[21:31] <mang0> I don't understand

0,[21:31] <reval> maxflax there's a guide I would recommend trying, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NattyUpgrades maybe that has something you missed, it seems legit
0,[21:32] <Cheese> Finaly got a hold of fedoras IRC Channel
0,[21:32] <maxflax> reval - intresting fact that the upgrade fails for some reason but some stupid dev has probably felt that putting the reason for the fail in the log was unecssicary
0,[21:33] <OY1R> guntbert: i can connect to freenode webchat, but i cant connect with xchat, blocked here at campus.

0,[21:34] <DOUK> yes
0,[21:34] <DOUK> thanks
0,[21:34] <guntbert> OY1R: I see -- no they use different protocols, xchat cannot talk http - you have to use your web browser
0,[21:34] <adsworth> that basically tells open calc to interpret the value as a string.
0,[21:34] <OY1R> guntbert: ok thanks anyways, perhaps i can find some usable free proxy.

0,[21:42] <reval> lordofthenoobs, I had a laptop ages ago that was a bit finicky about what programs worked well with it, my only advice is to look through the software center for video chat, and then also perhaps check out skype.

0,[21:59] <mehdi> i did all of those but it doesnt work
0,[21:59] <mehdi> iMAC 20 inch
0,[21:59] <vanksi> i have a situation where i have HostA --> FW1 --> Internet --> FW2 --> HostB and i have to determine which of the firewall blocks HTTPS connections from hostA to hostB. HTTPS works from hostB to hostA. is it possible to do this with nmap or some other fairly standard linux tool? i know it's a bit ot
0,[21:59] <edbian> lolmatic: YOu but your files in /var/www/
0,[22:00] <mehdi> its been 6 month i m chalenging this problem but it never solved
0,[22:00] <tensorpudding> mehdi: are you sure sound isn't working? do you have the volume unmuted?
0,[22:00] <gedO> GUYS
0,[22:00] <mehdi> yes i m sure and the sound is unmuted
0,[22:01] <Logan_> tensorpudding: you think he wouldn't have figured that out after six months? :P
0,[22:01] <gedO> What hapenned with my PC if I enter my username and password and nothing hapens
0,[22:01] <tensorpudding> mehdi: try opening Terminal, and type 'alsamixer'
0,[22:01] <abys> vansksi is the nat configured on fw2?
0,[22:01] <lolmatic> edbian: so i have to copy them manually? now i installed the package via synaptic... where are the wordpress files? 0_0
0,[22:01] <tensorpudding> mehdi: do you see OO in the Master column, or MM?
0,[22:01] <mehdi> i did it
0,[22:01] <sdoklo> could the problem be that lubuntu 10.10 cannot handle small disks anymore (30GB)? Installation and booting worked perfectly with an 80GB disk, unfortunately that disk is broken now.
0,[22:01] <g[r]eek> Hi, what does apt-get update do? And what's the difference between this and apt-get upgrade? Thanks.

0,[22:02] <mehdi> yes the Mic boos is 00
0,[22:02] <tensorpudding> mehdi: for stupid reasons ALSA, the Linux sound backend, might somehow mute the Master channel
0,[22:02] <edbian> lolmatic: Don't know where wordpress dumbs its files
0,[22:02] <mehdi> really
0,[22:02] <abys> vanski forget my nat suggestion, there is more chance fw2 blocs the flow than fw1
0,[22:02] <tensorpudding> mehdi: make sure "Front Speaker" is OO too
0,[22:02] <mehdi> u mean i mute the Master?
0,[22:02] <tensorpudding> mehdi: no, it needs to be unmuted
0,[22:03] <mcf3782> Since I posted the question earlier about Postfix resolving the wrong IP address, I'll post the solution. Thanks to the folks in #postfix.
0,[22:03] <mehdi> ok let me tell u Master is 00 Front is 00
0,[22:03] <reval> Osmodivs, I guess check synaptic package manager for other backports, you may try
0,[22:03] <tensorpudding> mehdi: if it says MM instead of OO, hit the arrow keys until it is highlighted, and hit the "m" key
0,[22:03] <reval> linux-backports-modules-net-generic  though. From what I am reading a backport from before jaunty made that wireless card work.
1,[22:03] <luite2> is there some way to add "open new tab" and "open new window" items to the unity button for Terminal?
0,[22:03] <adsworth> lolmatic, do you have synaptic installed. If so then you can check in the properties of the wordpress package where the files were installed to.
0,[22:03] <tensorpudding> mehdi: can you take a screenshot?
0,[22:03] <edbian> lolmatic: Found it:  sudo ln -s /usr/share/wordpress /var/www/wordpress
0,[22:03] <gedO> Guys, can someone help me
0,[22:03] <gedO> ?
0,[22:03] <edbian> lolmatic: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WordPress
0,[22:03] <mehdi> how di i take screen shoot
1,[22:03] <tensorpudding> luite2: yes, you have to mess with the guts of the .desktop file though
0,[22:04] <edbian> gedO: What is your problem?
0,[22:04] <tensorpudding> mehdi: run the program "Take Screenshot"
0,[22:04] <gedO> I enter my all data and nothing hapens any desktop enviroment isn't booting
0,[22:04] <edbian> tensorpudding: hahahaaha
0,[22:04] <hal> ok, here is the dialog box where the apply button is greyed out  http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/5030/screenshot001lo.png
0,[22:04] <edbian> gedO: Did you already install Ubuntu?
0,[22:04] <gedO> edbina: I can not work with my PC
0,[22:04] <Osmodivs> ravex, I cant find 'em with synaptic, I do not have internet accces, only WIFI conection
0,[22:04] <mcf3782> The problem is two-part.  The MX record for mail.bellsouth.net is wrong.  It returns an IP address that doesn't have an SMTP server running on it.
0,[22:04] <hal> does anyone know why this is happening please?
0,[22:04] <gedO> edbina: Yes
0,[22:04] <reval> hal I got mine to work by saving the connection name etc from the first window, then the second window was able to save
0,[22:04] <mehdi> from where from termintal?
0,[22:04] <gedO> edbina: First of all I get error that sayed unable to load "gnome"
0,[22:04] <edbian> hal: The other tabs are misconfigured perhaps?  Try changing hte connection name
0,[22:04] <Osmodivs> Hello. My NetBook is not reciving any WIFI signal, how come? I am reciving a signa in my desktop PC, I have Ubuntu 11.04 32 bits
0,[22:04] <tensorpudding> mehdi: it's available in the Applications menu
0,[22:05] <gedO> edbina: thene I installed LXDE
0,[22:05] <mehdi> yes i did
0,[22:05] <Dulak> mcf3782: did you try port 587 as well as port 25?  587 is submission so a valid smtp port
0,[22:05] <mcf3782> To make postfix ignore the MX record and instead use the A record, put  [ ] around the name of the relayhost:  relayhost = [mail.bellsouth.net]
0,[22:05] <mehdi> how to send it to u?
0,[22:05] <luite2> tensorpudding: hmm, ok
0,[22:05] <gedO> edbina: worked few hours
0,[22:05] <reval> hal fill out what you can in the wireless tab, and then save it and go back to the wireless security tab, I hope that helps

0,[22:06] <Advo> hi there, does anyone know what open source LGPL license means? from what ive read, it means i can do what I like with the code?
0,[22:07] <edbian> gedO: Where / when did you see the error about gnome.  Is there any details?
0,[22:07] <tensorpudding> mehdi: you can put it on imgur.com
0,[22:07] <xangua> Advo: wikipedia hay help you with tha
0,[22:07] <xangua> that*
0,[22:07] <mehdi> ok i ll now
0,[22:07] <coz_> Advo,  i believe LGPL allows distribution but no change
0,[22:07] <gedO> edbian: I saw wheen I tryed to log in (whene entering USER and PASSWORD)
0,[22:07] <Dulak> Advo: it means it's able to be used by other programs, but changes to the code still have to be given back to upstream
0,[22:07] <edbian> gedO: What is the complete error it gives?
0,[22:07] <coz_> Advo,     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html
0,[22:08] <gedO> edbian: Thene where "failer to load session 'gnome' "
0,[22:08] <luite2> tensorpudding: ah thanks, is it possible to do so without editing files in /usr/share?
0,[22:08] <Advo> ahh ok, thanks, that sucks then for this example
0,[22:08] <gedO> edbian: Thene where "failed to load session 'gnome' "
0,[22:08] <mehdi> ok its there now
0,[22:08] <edbian> gedO: That's all it said?  No reason why?  Do you have any idea why?
0,[22:08] <coz_> Advo,  ah yeah some developers use the LGPL  so reading the license and its "permissions"  is real important
0,[22:08] <tensorpudding> luite2: that's the place where application files are located, i think maybe you can add them in other directories
0,[22:08] <Dulak> Advo: BSD is probably more along the lines you were thinking
0,[22:09] <jay_pro> when installing ubuntu server and installing a mail server is selected, besides postfix, what exactly has already been installed? or how can i find out?
0,[22:09] <tensorpudding> mehdi: you need to give us a link
0,[22:09] <gedO> edbian: I don't know. Maiby gnome3 do this thing, but I used it several days
0,[22:09] <mehdi> http://imgur.com/zdkNS
0,[22:09] <edbian> gedO: I'm afraid I don't know.  Without more details I can't guess or troubleshoot either.
0,[22:09] <luite2> tensorpudding: yeah but they will probably get overwritten if theres an update for the package
0,[22:09] <lolmatic> hey guys, other question: why is banshee often unresponsive or slow? it hangs all the time. is my music collection too big? searches take ages, too...
0,[22:09] <mcf3782> Dulak - there is no Submission server running on port 587 of the incorrectly returned IP address.  Good thought though. I'd forgotten about that one.
0,[22:09] <hal> reval: ah, thank you. Actually I had the BBSID in the incorrect format  :)
0,[22:09] <tensorpudding> luite2: you'll probably need to create alternative ones then
0,[22:10] <mcf3782> The real answer is that at&t needs to fix their broken DNS.  But finding someone there who has a clue is well nigh impossible.
0,[22:10] <inglor_> hi all, how can I start the liveCD on vesa mode ???
0,[22:10] <tensorpudding> mehdi: okay, i can see that Master is MM
0,[22:10] <Dulak> mcf3782: that sucks, you sure you aren't blocked on port 25 outgoing by your provider?  you can get to other servers on port 25 ok?
0,[22:10] <gedO> edbian: I thing gdm or what it is wrong
0,[22:10] <mcf3782> So the best workaround with Postfix, seems to be using the [ ] around the name of the relayhost
0,[22:10] <tensorpudding> mehdi: you need to hit the left key a few times until the Master is highlighted, then hit the 'm' key so that there is OO on Master, then hit the ESC key
0,[22:11] <edbian> gedO: I have no clue

0,[22:14] <Dulak> badbandit: for production you don't want to use the django devel server, install apache with mod_wsgi and configure that, it'll handle a much higher load.

0,[22:16] <adsworth> the file /var/log/messages is empty?
0,[22:16] <mcf3782> brontosaurusrex If you're talking about an Apple Mac, with the native 'screen sharing' turned on; you can just use any VNC client to connect to it. 'screen sharing' uses VNC.
0,[22:16] <mehdi> there is a 100 also
0,[22:16] <tensorpudding> mehdi: above the number, inside the box, there should be a OO with a green background
0,[22:16] <adsworth> gedO, the file /var/log/messages is empty?

0,[22:17] <mehdi> yes there is 00 with green background

0,[22:31] <GraymanStole> I'm having an issue that I'm hoping someone here can help me with.
0,[22:31] <connor__> how do you enable the 3d cube workspace switcher
0,[22:31] <reval> I guess it is not a package =/
0,[22:31] <cablop> I have an ext3 external drive that uses ACLs... i need to access it from Windows, any suggestion? i need to keep the ACLs working, i am tempted to use one of these three options, cygwin, colinux a virtual machine... but, if there's something else much better for that, i'll be glad to hear it

0,[22:31] <afs97209> ubuntu install stuck at "Prepare to install"... just sit at that page.
0,[22:31] <dios_mio> I installed ubuntu on a win7 laptop, and I specified the "recovery OEM" partition of 400 mb as "swap"... now I want to install win7 on another partition and I think it will make use of that OEM partition.. then do I need to turn swap off in ubuntu?

0,[22:32] <adsworth> night all
0,[22:32] <GraymanStole> I have a Lenovo IdeaPad S10 Netbook running ubuntu 11.04
0,[22:32] <edbian> afs97209: 'hello'
0,[22:32] <reval> afs97209 did you import settings from another os?  when I did that mine took forever
0,[22:32] <xangua> dios_mio: now you have no recovery partition
0,[22:32] <GraymanStole> When I first boot up, the laptop gets very hot, and the fan does not run. The sensors command says the core temp is 17 - 21 C
0,[22:32] <gedO> adsworth: How to check?
0,[22:32] <cablop> dios_mio: forget about that oem partition, it HAD a recovery system of your win7... but you used it as SWAP meaning it is not going to work now
0,[22:32] <edbian> afs97209: I use Debian.  :)
0,[22:33] <afs97209> The basic install where you choose install. Hangs up right there. Won't go beyond
0,[22:33] <edbian> afs97209: Sounds like you have a bad CD.  Try burning again at a slower speed and do an MD5 checksum on the .iso before you burn it
0,[22:33] <GraymanStole> but it's way warmer than that. I reboot, and the fan turns on, sensors now read 55-61 C
0,[22:33] <afs97209> Right after you choose install
0,[22:33] <dios_mio> cablop and xangua, yeah but now I am about to install win on a third partition, side by side with ubuntu.. and it will probably make use of that recovery partition of 400 mb.. then ubuntu will be without a swap partition
0,[22:33] <hace> ok thx for help @ reval i ll try to test with acpi off

0,[22:34] <reval> good luck hace, I hope there is a good solution!

0,[22:36] <Frank_Jameso> connor there are a lot of ways to do that, but what specifically about it is slow?

0,[22:54] <Bookman> rannmann, oh, you mean the .vdi?
0,[22:54] <beinghuman> it waits on keyboard input at grub screen
0,[22:54] <ThinkT510> petisnnake: grub will detect windows and gives you the option to boot it
0,[22:54] <Polah> afs97209, perhaps try installing through command line rather than GUI
0,[22:54] <beinghuman> so it goes... kind of ridiculous if you ask me

0,[22:54] <rannmann> Yeah, the vdi
0,[22:54] <Bookman> rannmann, seems kind of drastic, no?
0,[22:54] <afs97209> Polah... I haven't tried that yet :)
0,[22:55] <afs97209> Let's see how that goes.
0,[22:55] <rannmann> Maybe, but that's what I would do.
0,[22:55] <maniak> jpgnizak, I had the same issues
0,[22:55] <jpgnizak> maniak,
0,[22:55] <jpgnizak> you find a solution?
0,[22:55] <maniak> I think it had something to do with the nvidia drivers
0,[22:55] <nit-wit> jpgnizak, is it a graphic problem have you tried a low graphic boot from that kernel
0,[22:55] <maniak> If I remember right, I could boot through the old kernels
0,[22:55] <jpgnizak> thats what im doing now
0,[22:55] <jpgnizak> actually
0,[22:56] <maniak> But if i tried the generic-pae kernels it would just hang
0,[22:56] <maniak> Right?
0,[22:56] <Grominx> so i want to put more space from my hard drive on my linux partition and less on my windows partition, how do i go about doing this without fucking everything up
0,[22:56] <rannmann> Does Ubuntu shove nouveau down your throat?
0,[22:56] <jpgnizak> yeah, just not the newest. yep, just hangs
0,[22:56] <maniak> Ok, then I think we had the same issue
0,[22:56] <jpgnizak> what did you do to fix?
0,[22:56] <Bookman> rannmann, thanks.
0,[22:56] <rayfranco> hi there
0,[22:56] <Tetsuo55_3> i think today's kernel update has a wifi regression, my connection is terriblke
0,[22:56] <maniak> I just booted into safe mode from the pae kernels
0,[22:57] <maniak> and then downloaded the nvidia drivers
0,[22:57] <maniak> from the official site
0,[22:57] <maniak> once I ran the nvidia script, I could boot fine
0,[22:57] <jpgnizak> ah, i will try that
0,[22:57] <tx0105_> does anywhere use Virtualbox by chance? I have no clue how to get the internet working on it...maybe someone on here knows (hopefully)
0,[22:57] <sa3eed> hello
0,[22:57] <rannmann> I'm not sure if this would help an ubuntu user, but I made some RHEL documentation regarding nVidia drivers: http://ranndesigns.com/wiki/index.php?title=Nvidia_driver
0,[22:57] <tx0105_> *does anyone use Virtualbox
0,[22:58] <maniak> What you can also do, is remove the xorg.conf in the /etc/X11 directory
0,[22:58] <jpgnizak> thanks maniak
0,[22:58] <rannmann> tx0105_: Are you running it in bridged mode?
0,[22:58] <maniak> It boots, but your graphics will look like crap
0,[22:58] <Dcite> tx0105_: I use VirtualBox, but with a Linux host and a Windows guest, what are you trying for?
0,[22:58] <maniak> So I'd recommend the nvidia drivers route
0,[22:58] <jpgnizak> great, ill try that now,
0,[22:58] <rayfranco> I'd like to know if it's possible to tell ffmpeg to extract X images from a video, but based on the video length (for example, 4 images from 100s video would give me an image at 0s, 25s, 50s, 100s)
0,[22:58] <CandidMan> Dcite: Ditto
0,[22:59] <tx0105_> rannmann - I'm thinking no...I don't know what bridged mode is yet...all the documentation i found online is confusing
0,[22:59] <Dcite> rayfranco: Try mplayer -ss hh:mm:ss -frames filename.avi
0,[22:59] <tx0105_> dcite - I'm running Mint 10...Windows XP in Virtualbox...I'm trying to get online in Virtualbox
0,[22:59] <Dcite> rayfranco: Try mplayer -ss hh:mm:ss -frames filename.avi -vo png
0,[22:59] <rannmann> tx0105_: I believe it defaults to NAT.  Right click yoru VM and go to "Network"
0,[23:00] <rannmann> Make sure it's set to "Bridged Adapter"
0,[23:00] <Dcite> tx0105_: How is it currently setup? If bridged is dhcp setup? How about static settings? If on NAT, put windows into DHCP mode
0,[23:00] <Dcite> rannmann: I have ubuntu 10.10 and NAT mode works fine x.x Least for internet
0,[23:01] <rayfranco> Dcite: I don't use mplayer, but this command looks like what I can actually do with ffmepeg, it will give me a frame at a specified time (or actually starting at a specific time)
0,[23:01] <Bookman> rannmann, I just had to stop the process running in the background.  Solved the issue and I can keep the .vdi.
0,[23:01] <rannmann> Bookman: Glad to hear it!
0,[23:01] <rannmann> Dcite: I've had bad luck with most VM software and NAT.  Changing it to bridged is a good test, at least.
0,[23:02] <rayfranco> Should I do pre-treatment to get the video length ? (Note : It's going to be used by a script, not by me ;) )
0,[23:02] <Dcite> rayfranco: I never tried with ffmpeg directly, you'lll have to test, but give mplayer a try at times :)
0,[23:02] <Bookman> rannmann, Thanks!  Your solution was my next one and still might be if I don't figure out why it froze!
0,[23:02] <martin_> Hello everyone
0,[23:02] <rayfranco> Dcite: I'll have a look thanks
0,[23:02] <petisnnake> Should I install 64bit Ubuntu only if I have amd processor?
0,[23:02] <martin_> ubuntu doesn't seem to recognize my ethernet controller
0,[23:02] <martin_> what gives?
0,[23:02] <nerdshell> when writing a Script, is it the processor that reads the lines beginning with # ?
0,[23:02] <Dcite> rayfranco: can you give a more specific use case?
0,[23:02] <martin_> it doesn't show up in lspci. nor does it show up in ifconfig
0,[23:03] <arand> nerdshell: Apart from the #!/bin/*sh line all #-lines are ignored.
0,[23:03] <Dcite> nerdshell: for shell scripts all lines starting with # except line 1 is ignored
0,[23:03] <tx0105_> rannmann - do you need to select bridged?
0,[23:04] <rannmann> tx0105_: I always do.
0,[23:04] <tx0105_> dcite - I'm looking at the settings now in VBox...it's currently on NAT...do I select bridged?
0,[23:04] <petisnnake> so.... should i install 64bit ubuntu if I have an intel proc?
0,[23:04] <Dcite> tx0105_: Bridged mode is ideal, please remember to configure it like you would any computer once inside
0,[23:04] <nerdshell> arand: Dcite : ok, and who reads line 1 ?
0,[23:05] <Dcite> nerdshell: The shell running it reads line 1
0,[23:05] <Andy_C> Hi,
0,[23:05] <Andy_C> any hardware experts?

0,[23:08] <Andy_C> The details from Additional Drivers states "This package contains Broadcom 802.11 Linux STA wireless driverfor use with Broadcom's BCM4311-, BCM4312-, BCM4313-, BCM4321-,BCM4322-, BCM43224-, and BCM43225-, BCM43227- and BCM43228-basedhardware."
0,[23:08] <osse> Has the choice between trying Ubuntu from the LiveCD and starting the installer directly been relegated to the Grub menu in 11.04 or is it just my CD that is acting weird?
0,[23:08] <Andy_C> I have the BCM4313 card
0,[23:08] <Dcite> Andy_C: Seems right, does the activate button do anything?
0,[23:09] <Andy_C> it is activated and currently in use
0,[23:09] <cybrhuman> hi, anyone here know how to remove the notifications in the right upper corner?
0,[23:09] <Dcite> Andy_C: usually EITHER the STA or the B73 driver works, try both please
0,[23:09] <rannmann> Use something other than gnome ;)
0,[23:09] <Andy_C> Thanks Dcite. I am utterly new to Linux - while I have done lots of reading, this is my first attempt at diving ing
0,[23:10] <cybrhuman> rannmann: hehe, yes, but assume I am trying to help someone who doesn't like tilers
0,[23:10] <arand> osse: Either you do it from the first installer screen, or hit a key during the first boot screen of the CD to choose the alternative and different options, the LiveCD uses isolinux (syslinux?) by the way.
0,[23:10] <Andy_C> I have no idea how to try other drivers

0,[23:11] <Frank_Jameso> cybrhuman do you mean for when you get an im or have available updates?
0,[23:11] <winstonw> Hi. Just so you know, bshellz.net users are banned from this channel, not just a handful of bad users.
0,[23:11] <osse> arand, thanks. Maybe I accidentally hit a button during boot that stopped the grub countdown then. There was a stack of papers on top of my keyboard at the time :)

1,[23:15] <JPP> winstonw: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/indicator-keylock-ubuntu/ looks like a good indicator.
0,[23:15] <Dulak> Andy_C: there is a little switch on the side of most laptops now that can turn on and off the wireless, look and see if you hit that on accident
1,[23:16] <osse> winstonw, scroll down a bit until you reach "Indicator keylock" on this page: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/01/the-omg-guide-to-must-have-indicator-applets/

0,[23:23] <Flannel> Ricoshady: 18 months
0,[23:23] <shmup_> curious, if i'm dual booting and install ubuntu second, say i have /sda1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all these partitions..
0,[23:23] <shmup_> where is the mbr exactly?
0,[23:24] <shmup_> where ubuntu is installing the grub to
0,[23:24] <Snicers> I recently upgraded to Natty but now I can't get "tasksel" to work, it just says Aptitude failed. Is this normal?
0,[23:24] <JPP> shmup_: MBR is not a partition.
0,[23:24] <shmup_> is that in /sda itself, no # after it
0,[23:24] <shmup_> right, JPP
0,[23:24] <shmup_> JPP: so it'd just be in /sda
0,[23:24] <JPP> The Master Boot Record is a special set of blocks at the beginning of a drive. So yes, shmup_ , /dev/sda
0,[23:24] <JPP> or whatever the drive is.
0,[23:24] <Ricoshady> and lts is 24 months?
0,[23:24] <tmbg> [16:56:15] <rannmann> Does Ubuntu shove nouveau down your throat? <-- yes, and this bugs the crap out of me.
0,[23:24] <welaunchit> Anyone else getting a bug in Natty where maximizing certain windows causes them to "blank" or "white" out? I've been wanting to file a bug on this, but can't quite determine whether it's a "Ubuntu" issue or a "Gnome" issue...
0,[23:25] <rannmann> Hah!
0,[23:25] <tmbg> I've had several machines that have graphics cards that lock up with nouveau and I'm not offered an option to switch between at install.
0,[23:25] <rannmann> I know the Fedora workaround, but I'm not familiar with the Ubuntu one
0,[23:25] <tmbg> I get random lockups and have to manually rip out all of the nouveau b.s.
0,[23:25] <Simkin> 11.04 is really slow and weird
0,[23:25] <rannmann> Honestly, I refuse to use Ubuntu
0,[23:25] <Simkin> i'm having some strange problems. i wish I didn't upgrade now.
0,[23:25] <aeon-ltd> Simkin: describe them
0,[23:25] <tmbg> took me quite some time to figure out the issue the first time
0,[23:26] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: i'm trying but having difficulty...
0,[23:26] <tx0105_> hey for those that were helping me with Virtualbox...I set the network settings to Bridged, choose wlan0 yet when I boot XP in VBox...there are no internet connections or devices shown
0,[23:26] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: the biggest problem is there seems to be this huge drag on the system.
0,[23:26] <tx0105_> is there something else I need to do?
0,[23:26] <aeon-ltd> Simkin: like lag?
0,[23:26] <rannmann> Yeah, me too.  I wrote a wiki article about it so I never have to remember.
0,[23:26] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: everythign seems.. slow... playing music gets gitttery.
0,[23:26] <Simkin> when i switch virtual desktops
1,[23:26] <aeon-ltd> Simkin: using unity?
0,[23:26] <Simkin> no, kde.
0,[23:27] <tx0105_> on another note...does anyone here use Ubuntu on a machine with Intel video drivers?
0,[23:27] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: this is a 16gb of ram, 6 core machine.. it shouldn't seem laggy!
0,[23:27] <aeon-ltd> Simkin: monitor a process/activity monitor see what's consuming the cpu
0,[23:27] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: i did that.... folding at home is using a lot of cpu (but it runs in idle so not an issue)
0,[23:27] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: nothin else really shows up
0,[23:27] <aeon-ltd> Simkin: how about ram?
0,[23:27] <shmup_> JPP: okay i was really just wondering if manually installing grub to /sda itself would potentially mess up partitions
0,[23:28] <shmup_> JPP: thank you :)
0,[23:28] <tx0105_> I've tried both Kubuntu and Ubuntu 11.04 on this laptop and my video resolution is all screwed up...it automatically makes it 1024x768 and if I try to increase the resolution in the control panel, Kubuntu practically crashes and Ubuntu doesn't do much better
0,[23:28] <tx0105_> therefore I'm using Mint 10 until this is fixed..or I figure out how to make it work
0,[23:28] <Andy_C> test
0,[23:29] <LjL> Andy_C: works
0,[23:29] <Andy_C> thanks
0,[23:29] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: 16gb of ram, 8gb in use, no swap.
0,[23:29] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: i have a hunch it's realted to video.. nvidia.
0,[23:29] <Simkin> because lots of display changes seems to be linked.
0,[23:29] <Simkin> but i can't be sure.
0,[23:30] <Andy_C> output of 'rfkill list all' http://paste.ubuntu.com/603926/
0,[23:31] <Andy_C> can someone tell me why rfkill is telling me I have 3 wireless cards?
0,[23:31] <aeon-ltd> Simkin: then the only way is to test that, using compiz? disable it, then if no changes swap between no driver, open source and proprietry. before all this though update everything and maybe restart the session or even the pc
0,[23:32] <qin> Andy_C: What about iwconfig
0,[23:32] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: my #1 concern is a drive is failing at this moment.. is there any way to test if the problem is IO bound?
0,[23:32] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: how can you install "different version" of drivers using apt?
0,[23:32] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: using gentoo I would "emerge nvidia-drivers-version#"
0,[23:32] <Simkin> but with apt I can't seem to find a way to specifiy a version
0,[23:32] <Simkin> i'd like to downgrade
0,[23:32] <Simkin> or upgrade
0,[23:32] <Simkin> and see if it makes a diff
0,[23:33] <cybrhuman> Anyone know a command that show the file installed by a package?
0,[23:33] <aeon-ltd> Simkin: unistall proprietry then use 'nouveau'
0,[23:33] <aeon-ltd> !nouveau
0,[23:33] <ubottu> nouveau is an open-source nvidia driver included by default in 10.04. Currently 3D rendering is unsupported. More information can be found in http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/ - See also !nvidia

0,[23:33] <Simkin> aeon-ltd: but using a diff version # would work, is this possible?
0,[23:33] <Jordan_U> erix: You use "ln -s" to create symlinks.

However, it returns an error like " /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Could not open configuration file /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/sites-available: No such file or directory". What do you think this problem occurs from symlink configuration ?
0,[23:41] <rach0> Snicers, it's not a cron job nor an infinite loop as i wrote it to show only once, but it seems the notifciation daemon in ubuntu has forked it or now spams it regulary

0,[23:42] <gcristian> hello, how can I add a user to sudoer's list ?
0,[23:42] <Snicers> it should be /etc/apache2/sites-available or /etc/apache2/sites-enabled right?
0,[23:42] <qin> Andy_C: Bluetooth, 3G, hm? Not certain.
0,[23:43] <erix> right it is /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/

0,[23:47] <marek_> hello
0,[23:47] <rach0> kostkon, 10x!
0,[23:48] <rannmann> ksidirt: Use VirtualBox if you want to run it within Windows7, or just install it on a free partition and grub should set up dual booting for you by default.

0,[23:56] <zul__> anyone can solve  a problem in svn, I'm a newbie and I have this error: svn: '.' is not a working copy
1,[23:56] <Maarten> Hmmm..... What do you guys think of Unity? I am a Gnome 2.x guy on 10.10 Ubuntu, and I have been reading a lot of bad reviews on Unity as of late.... I know I can force it back to Gnome 2, or try Gnome 3 (which does look nice from screenshots), but is Unity really the way Ubuntu is going?
0,[23:56] <wasabi> zul__: That means you're not in a working copy.
0,[23:56] <wasabi> zul__: Read the manual.
0,[23:56] <Habstinat> How can I connect to a WebDAV server graphically in Ubuntu? (In 11.04)

0,[23:57] <perlsyntax> Anyone know how to get wlan-ng to work?
1,[23:57] <Bibleboy> i like unity
1,[23:57] <crazedpsyc> Maarten, Unity is great
0,[23:57] <IdleOne> crazedpsyc: #ubuntu+1 is not even open yet
0,[23:57] <crazedpsyc> (imho)
0,[23:57] <GraymanStole> Anyone good with hardware?
0,[23:57] <zul__> I'm in the working copy. I installed svn on /home/svn/repository/project
0,[23:57] <perlsyntax> i download it nd my wirele card not working.
0,[23:57] <slickho> sgaap: what about this article? The guy says it still uses 2.6.28. are you sure it's 2.6.38 by default?
0,[23:57] <slickho> http://www.itworld.com/operating-systems/161961/ubuntu-1104-natty-narwhal-best-hrefhttpwwwitworldcomlinuxlinuxa-desktop-eve
1,[23:57] <busigast> unity is evil i tell you
0,[23:57] <perlsyntax> ?
0,[23:57] <crazedpsyc> IdleOne, yeah, I noticed when I got redirected here
0,[23:57] <Bibleboy> im kind of good
0,[23:57] <wasabi> zul__: You don't install svn into a working copy.
0,[23:58] <wasabi> Read the manual.
1,[23:58] <cntrational> Maarten: eh, well, Unity has potential, but it feels a bit...unpolished, right now
1,[23:58] <Maarten> I'm just not convinced yet.... it looks a bit.... plastic. I might just switch to Debian 6 for some time.
0,[23:58] <perlsyntax> Does anyone know how to get my wireless card to work with wlan-ng?
0,[23:58] <rcconf> no one cant help

0,[23:59] <wasabi> zul__: You're at least misusing terms... so if you don't even know the proper terms, I'd read the manual and at least get that far.
0,[23:59] <busigast> Habstinat, i have no idea, but google allways helps me out, well not allways but you get my point :)
